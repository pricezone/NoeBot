/**
 * The Bot's browser, and the profile that outlives it.
 *
 * A persistent profile lets a Bot remain signed in across process and container restarts.
 *
 * Persistent context, not a saved storage state. Playwright can export cookies and localStorage as
 * JSON and replay them, and that is the wrong tool here: it captures what the automation knew about,
 * on demand, and misses IndexedDB, service workers, and anything written after the snapshot.
 * `launchPersistentContext` points Chromium at a real user-data directory, so the browser persists
 * its own state the way it does on a desktop. On a mounted volume, that directory outlives the
 * container.
 *
 * Profile behavior in this image and Playwright version:
 *   - A cookie with an expiry survives close-and-reopen. So does localStorage.
 *   - A session cookie (no expiry) does not: Chromium drops those on restart, exactly as a desktop
 *     browser does. Here a restart is a pod being deleted by an idle suspend or an image update, so
 *     `session-cookies.ts` writes them to a file in the same profile and puts them back on launch.
 *   - Killing the browser process with SIGKILL leaves no stale singleton lock in the profile, and the
 *     profile reopens with its cookies intact. The widely-reported `SingletonLock` breakage does not
 *     reproduce here. The defensive sweep below stays anyway, because it is three lines and the
 *     failure it prevents is "the computer never comes back".
 *
 * One profile per Bot. Two Bots sharing a profile share their logins, which makes "this Bot may reach
 * Salesforce" unenforceable: whatever one signs into, the other is signed into. Each Bot gets its own
 * directory, so its cookies and its storage are its own.
 *
 * A profile is not a container. Two Bots in this process are isolated from each other's cookies, not
 * from each other's kernel, filesystem or memory.
 *
 * Container-per-Bot needs something privileged to create containers, and the API server must never be
 * that: access to the Docker socket is unrestricted root on the host. Stop and reset are
 * operations this process applies to its own browser, so the same design works under Compose,
 * Kubernetes or ECS, where the orchestrator's own restart policy brings a process back.
