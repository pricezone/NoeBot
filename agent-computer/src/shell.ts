 * Running a command on the Bot's computer.

 * WHY THIS EXISTS. A browser answers questions about the web; a shell answers everything else. A Bot
 * that can install a tool and run it is a Bot that can do the task rather than describe it.
 *
 * WHAT MAKES IT SAFE IS NOT THIS FILE. Nothing here decides whether a command may run. The gateway
 * decides, against the deployment's policy, and writes the audit row before this is called at all,
 * the same as it does for a click. This file is the hands, not the judgement.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES DEFEND is the shape of the call rather than its content: a command cannot run
 * forever, cannot return unbounded output, runs in the workspace rather than wherever the process
 * happens to be, and does not inherit the computer's environment, so `env` cannot print the
 * deployment's secrets.
 *
 * ISOLATION IS THE CONTAINER'S JOB. A shell can reach whatever the container can reach, so the
 * deployment that gives a Bot one should give each Bot a computer of its own. In a container shared
 * between Bots, a shell is shared too.

 * is the secrets that existed on the day it was written; the next variable added to a deployment
 * is not on it.
 *
 * PATH, locale, terminal and the proxy variables pass because a command that cannot find `apt-get`,
 * cannot speak the operator's language, or cannot reach the network behind a corporate proxy is not
 * a shell. Proxy URLs routinely carry a password; userinfo is stripped before the value is copied, so
 * `env` cannot print it. Naming the credentialed URL in COMPUTER_SHELL_ENV is an operator's decision
 * rather than the default. Everything else is named there too, read as names.
 *
