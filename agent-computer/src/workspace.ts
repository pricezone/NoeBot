/**
 * The Bot's files, and the boundary they must not escape.
 *
 * The computer has a `/workspace` volume so that anything a Bot should still have next week
 * survives the container. A Bot can read and write in it, which turns a durable directory into an
 * attack surface: the process runs as root inside its container, so `write_file("../../etc/passwd")`
 * is the obvious first thing to try and `read_file("../../root/.ssh/id_rsa")` the second.
 *
 * Path confinement is enforced in three layers:
 *
 *  1. Absolute paths are refused outright. A Bot names a file relative to its own workspace; there is
 *     no legitimate request that begins with `/`.
 *  2. The resolved path must be inside the root lexically. This catches `..` traversal.
 *  3. The resolved path must still be inside the root after symlinks are followed. This is the layer
 *     people miss: a symlink placed inside the workspace (by an earlier write, or by a page the Bot
 *     downloaded something from) passes the lexical check and then points anywhere on the filesystem.
 *     For a write, the file may not exist yet, so the deepest existing ancestor gets resolved, which
 *     is the directory the write will land in, AND the name itself is resolved when something is
 *     already there, because `writeFile` follows a link at the last component too.
 *
 * A factory taking its root as an argument rather than reading the environment, so the confinement
 * can be tested against a temporary directory instead of being taken on trust.
