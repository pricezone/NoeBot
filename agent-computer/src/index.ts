/**
 * The Bot's computer: one long-lived browser, reachable over HTTP.
 *
 * Acting on a page lives in this process because only this process holds the browser. In the
 * intended deployment path, the server gateway decides whether an action may run and records the
 * audit row before calling this process. This process has no policy engine and no audit trail of its
 * own; its direct-port boundary is the computer token.
 *
 * `/files/read`, `/files/download` and `/files/write` reach the durable workspace volume, confined
 * to it by workspace.ts. Reading and writing are the two operations a Bot needs to keep notes between
 * turns; download returns the exact bytes so a PDF, image or archive is not damaged by text decoding.
 *
 * Elements are addressed by reference, not by pixel. `/snapshot` stamps every interactive element
 * with a ref and hands back a compact list; `/click` and `/type` take one of those refs. That is the
 * accessibility-tree-first driver this is built on, and it is why filling in a form needs no
 * vision model at all: the Bot reads a list of fields rather than squinting at a picture and guessing
 * coordinates. Pixels remain the eventual fallback for canvas-style pages that expose no elements.
 *
 * One browser stays open so state survives between
 * turns: a session it signed into an hour ago is still signed in now. Launching per request would
 * make every task start from a cold, logged-out browser, which is the behaviour we are specifically
 * trying not to have.
 *
 * It authenticates its caller: every request must present the secret below, and the process refuses
 * to start without one. That is a lock on the door rather than a reason to put the door somewhere
 * public. It still belongs on the deployment network, behind the server that decides who is asking.
