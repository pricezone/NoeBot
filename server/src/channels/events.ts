/**
 * Live channel activity, from whoever ran an agent to everybody else in the channel.
 *
 * The person who ran it already has the reply and reports it over HTTP; this is the other direction,
 * telling the channel's other members that something was said. It is an optimisation and never a
 * source of truth: the roster query stays authoritative, and a client that misses events while
 * disconnected recovers by refetching on reconnect. Nothing may be knowable only through the socket.
 *
 * Delivery goes through Postgres rather than an in-process list, because an in-process list is
 * silently wrong the moment a second server instance exists: the writer is on one and the listener
 * on the other, and the message is never delivered.
 *
 * A NOTIFY is never replayed, so an announcement made while this subscription is down is gone. The
 * client's own "refetch on reconnect" does not cover it: the socket that dropped is this server's,
 * not the browser's. `resyncAll` is the signal that closes that gap.
