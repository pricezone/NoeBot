 * What somebody is told when the broker itself failed, and what is deliberately kept out of it.
 *
 * EVERY BROKERED ROUTE NEEDS THIS AND NONE OF THEM USED TO HAVE IT. A listing, a connect, a confirm
 * and a disconnect all end in a call to another company's API, and an unhandled rejection out of any
 * of them is a bare 500 with the vendor's thrown object on this deployment's console. That object is
 * the whole HTTP response — headers, trace ids, rate-limit counters — and the person reading the 500
 * gets none of it and no sentence either. A wrong `COMPOSIO_API_KEY` is the first failure a new
 * operator meets, and it is the one this used to answer worst.
 *
 * `vendorSentence` IS THE SAME ONE THE TRANSPORT USES, for the same reason it exists there: the
 * useful sentence — "Invalid API key", "No connected account found for user …" — is nested two
 * levels inside `cause` beside everything that must not be shown, so this reaches in for that one
 * string and takes nothing else. Null from it is a failure this deployment cannot explain, and the
 * caller's own generic sentence is what a reader gets instead of the vendor's placeholder.
 *
 * NOTHING FROM THE REQUEST OR THE ANSWER TRAVELS WITH IT. Not the API key, which never leaves the
 * adapter; not a connect link, which is a bearer capability handed to one browser; and not the
 * thrown object, whether by spreading it, stringifying it or logging it.
 *
 * 502 RATHER THAN 500, because nothing here broke: this deployment asked a third party and the third
 * party did not answer usefully, which is the same reading the dynamic-registration failure below
 * already gives.
 *
 * `./broker`'s `BrokerRefusalError` IS THE EXCEPTION, AND IT IS A WIDER ONE THAN IT WAS. It used to
 * be the one no-key state; it is now every refusal the broker layer AUTHORED — no key, an app whose
 * authorization config this deployment never created or cannot use, a consent the vendor answered
 * with nowhere to send anybody, a catalogue too large to be sure of. All of them share the property
 * that made the first one special: Composio answered, this deployment decided, and the sentence
 * already names the step that fixes it. So the message is passed through and the status stays 503,
 * which reads correctly for every one of them — the brokered surface is unavailable for this app
 * until somebody changes something here, rather than unavailable because a third party is down. The
 * generic sentence below is for failures this deployment genuinely cannot explain, and answering one
 * of these with it would tell an administrator to check a key that is fine.

   * fine. This route is `requireAdmin`, which is what makes showing that sentence here safe.
   *

   * vault revokes, the trail writes, the deletes — and half of it is the broker, so a failure that
   * neither `brokerSentence` nor `vendorSentence` put words to is one where which half failed is

     * and it chose to say nothing.
     *
     * CONCATENATED WITHOUT REWRITING, because the fields a settings page draws from — the server
     * id, the scope, the date — line up across the two reads, and one row template can draw either
     * kind. What does not line up is what `brokeredConnectionsFor` adds — `verified`, `verifiedAt`,
     * `probe` and `checkable` — so the list that leaves here is not uniform. Those travel because a
     * brokered row is the only one with anything to re-check: this deployment holds no secret for

     * cannot be read alone — three situations share one `verified: false`, and which action the
     * check actually SPENT is what separates them on a page that has done nothing but load.
     *
     * `probe` AND `checkable` ARE TWO ANSWERS AND NOT ONE SENT TWICE, and a caller that treats them
     * as interchangeable breaks the page in one of two opposite ways. `probe` is a record of the
     * check that was made; `checkable` is whether the app has anything to check with NOW. They
     * agreed while the first was derived, and an administrator's press of Refresh moved what the
     * app publishes without touching what the check spent — so the page accused a key nobody had
     * tried. Recording the first fixed that and deadlocked the other half: a key nothing was spent
     * on reads null for good, and the button that is the only way to ever spend one was gated on
     * that null. So the sentence is drawn off `probe` and the button off `checkable`; see
     * `brokeredConnectionsFor`, which sets both failures out in full. A held connection has no
     * equivalent question, so its rows carry none of these fields, and their absence is what tells
     * the two READS apart. It is not how a reader learns how an app connects: that is the app's
     * recorded `authScheme`, and a page asking this list instead would be deriving a second answer
     * to a question the row already carries.
     *
     * SORTED, so two requests answer in the same order. Each read is ordered by server id within
     * its own table, and concatenating two sorted lists is not a sorted list. Compared as plain

         * THE CLAIM THIS RESTS ON, STATED RATHER THAN ASSUMED: EVERY FIELD SCHEME IN COMPOSIO'S
         * CATALOGUE PUBLISHES AT LEAST ONE REQUIRED FIELD, BECAUSE A FIELD SCHEME IS COMPOSIO'S OWN
         * STATEMENT THAT THE PERSON HOLDS A CREDENTIAL. What makes it a claim about the catalogue
         * rather than a guess is that "this app needs nothing" already has its own name there:
         * `NO_AUTH` sits beside `API_KEY`, `BASIC`, `BEARER_TOKEN` and `BASIC_WITH_JWT` in the
         * vendor's own scheme enum (`@composio/core` 0.18.1, `src/types/authConfigs.types.ts:9-24`),
         * and this route answers it in its own branch a few lines above — so an app that reached
         * HERE has told Composio it needs SOMETHING, and a field list requiring nothing is not that
         * app saying it needs nothing after all.
         *
         * AND THE SDK SAYS WHAT THE SOMETHING IS, PER SCHEME. `connectedAccountAuthStates.types.ts`
         * declares the shape of an ACTIVE account one scheme at a time: `BASIC` and `BASIC_WITH_JWT`
         * require `username` and `password`, `BEARER_TOKEN` requires `token`, and `NO_AUTH` requires
         * nothing at all — an ACTIVE no-auth account is the base row and no credential beside it.
         * `API_KEY` is the one that marks `api_key` and `generic_api_key` optional, and it does so
         * because the NAME of the box varies across the catalogue and both spellings occur in it,
         * not because an API_KEY account may hold no key: the same declaration keeps a `catchall`
         * for the third spelling. Three of the four field schemes therefore say in the vendor's own
         * types that an account of theirs carries a credential, and the fourth says which credential
         * it cannot name.
         *
         * WHAT WAS NOT DONE, AND IT IS THE HONEST LIMIT OF THE CLAIM: the live catalogue was not
         * enumerated. There is no network and no Composio key on this path, so "no toolkit publishes
         * a field scheme with an empty required list" is ARGUED from the vendor's own package rather
         * than counted across its apps. The guard is written to fail in the safe direction for that
         * reason. If such an app does exist, it becomes an app this deployment will not connect and
         * SAYS SO, with a remedy addressed to the one person who could change it — which is the
         * direction the empty-list guard directly above already chose, and the opposite of the
         * silent credential-less account that is the alternative.
         *
         * THE STATE UNDER THIS GUARD IS ONE STATE AND NOT TWO, WHICH IS WHAT MAKES IT DECIDABLE AT
         * ALL. "An app whose required flags we could not read" used to be indistinguishable from
         * "an app that requires nothing", and it is no longer: {@link ComposioBroker.connectionFields}
         * reads each flag through `flagOf`, which answers the caller's default for an ABSENT flag
         * and refuses one that is PRESENT and not a boolean. So a list arriving here with every
         * `required` false is the vendor's own no on every row — never a shape this deployment
         * failed to read, because that shape never gets past the adapter.
         *
         * ON THE APP AND NOT ON THE SUBMISSION, AND THE SEEDED DEFAULT IS WHY. A guard that demanded
         * one non-blank value would be satisfied by the form's own work: the form draws each box
         * holding the default the app published and posts every published name back whether or not
         * anybody touched it, so a person who types nothing at an app publishing an optional
         * `base_url` submits that default — non-blank, unchosen, and a credential in no sense. The
         * thing that is false here is the app's field list, so the app is what is refused.
         *
         * ON THE SUBMISSION AND NOT ON THE PRESS ABOVE IT, for the empty-list guard's reason: the
         * list is a true answer to "what does this app ask for", and what is false is the account
         * the next press would make.

         * hands Composio, beside the literal `status: "ACTIVE"` that call sets — so an unfiltered

         * was asked for and a first tool call that discovers it.
         *
         * REFUSED, BECAUSE A PERSON CANNOT TYPE A NAME THE FORM DID NOT DRAW. The form is drawn
         * from this same list a moment earlier, so every name in an ordinary submission is one of
         * these; a name that is not leaves exactly two readings, and dropping it silently is the
         * wrong answer to both. If the app's published fields have moved, the person is holding a
         * stale form and the honest thing is to send them back for the current one — connecting
         * them with the part that still matches makes a credential-less account that every screen
         * here draws as connected. And if it is a caller reaching past the form on purpose,
         * "connected" is the one answer they must not get for a request this deployment edited
         * behind their back. Pressing Connect again costs a person one press and redraws the form
         * from what the app asks for now.
         *

         * once the check is done, so what reaches the store is the published subset by
         * construction and not on the strength of the loop above having run.
         *
         * A VALUE THAT IS NOT TEXT IS THE SAME REFUSAL. The store's signature promises strings, and
         * a number or an object under a published name is a lie told to that signature that reaches
         * Composio as whatever JSON makes of it.
         *
         * AND THE BAG HOLDS ONLY WHAT WAS PUT IN IT, WHICH `{}` DOES NOT. Every name here is the
         * VENDOR's — chosen by whoever publishes the app at Composio and never by this deployment —
         * and a plain object literal answers for names nobody submitted: `values.constructor` and
         * `values.toString` come back as functions off `Object.prototype`, so the required guard
         * below calls `.trim()` on a function and answers a person who typed nothing wrong with a
         * 500. A prototype value that happened to be TEXT would be worse still, because that guard
         * would count a credential nobody supplied and connect the account anyway. The other
         * direction fails silently: `values["__proto__"] = "acme"` on a literal reaches the
         * prototype setter, which ignores a string, so a value somebody typed is dropped between
         * the check that admitted it and the store that was meant to receive it — an account made
         * at Composio without one of the values the app publishes, marked `ACTIVE` because Composio
         * does not grade what it is handed, and drawn as connected on every screen here.
         *
         * A NULL-PROTOTYPE BAG IS THE WHOLE FIX AND IT IS THE SAME ONE THE FORM USES. Nothing is
         * inherited, so a read answers `undefined` exactly when nobody submitted that name and a
         * write stores what it was given under whatever name it was given. `Object.keys` — which is

   * ever been checked. The store raises with Composio's own sentence in it, and this passes that
   * through as a refusal the browser surfaces. The only `verified: false` that arrives as an answer
