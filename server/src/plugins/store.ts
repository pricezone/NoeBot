 * backslash and then `u0000`, which is how a JSON Schema excludes control characters and is by far
 * the commonest place those six letters legitimately appear — is handed back untouched.
 *
 * CRITERION TWO. Everything else is rebuilt identical: the same keys, the same nesting, the same
 * scalars.
 *
 * WHAT THIS REPLACED, and why walking the DATA is not a stylistic preference. The strip used to run
 * over the SERIALISED schema — `JSON.stringify(schema).replaceAll("\\u0000", "")` — which is
 * escape-blind by construction. `JSON.stringify` writes a real backslash inside a string value as
 * two of them, so a pattern such as `"[^\u0000-\u001f]"` reached the strip with its backslash
 * doubled and had the TAIL of it eaten, leaving `\-`. That is not a JSON escape, so the
 * `JSON.parse` wrapped around it threw a `SyntaxError` — from a line that sat outside BOTH `try`
 * blocks in `refreshTools`. It left as a bodiless 500 with `lastError` still holding whatever it
 * held before, and on the add path, which refreshes before it answers, it aborted the add AFTER the
 * server row and its audit row had committed.
 *
 * Serialised text cannot tell the byte from the six letters that name it; parsed data can only ever
 * hold one of them. So walking the data is what makes CRITERION ONE expressible at all.
 *
 * A SELF-REFERENTIAL VALUE IS REFUSED rather than quietly truncated, and `ancestors` holds only the
 * chain currently being descended — so one object reached twice side by side is copied twice, which
 * is what a plain JSON document does anyway. Nothing off a wire can be cyclic; a value built inside
 * this process can, and it is a value `jsonb` would refuse in any case. Refused HERE it is a
 * sentence the caller can record; left to the driver it is a statement dump.

/**
 * What a vendor listed, as rows this database will actually take.
 *
 * CRITERION ONE. No two rows carry the same name, whatever the vendor listed.
 *
 * CRITERION TWO. No string reaching the insert contains U+0000, in a column or inside a schema —
 * and nothing else about what the vendor wrote is altered to achieve it, which is a criterion of
 * its own because the first attempt at this one failed it. See {@link storableSchema}.
 *
 * CRITERION THREE. Whatever this raises, its caller catches — see the `try` around the one call
 * site. Everything here runs OUTSIDE the vendor `try` and before the transaction's own, so a throw
 * from here left `refreshTools` unhandled: a bodiless 500, a `lastError` still holding whatever it
 * held before, and an add aborted after its server row and its audit row had already committed.
 *
 * REASON. Both of these used to abort the replace from INSIDE the transaction and OUTSIDE the
 * vendor `try` above it, so they came out of `refreshTools` as a raw `DrizzleQueryError` — whose
 * message is `Failed query: <the whole statement>` followed by `params:` and every value bound to
 * it. That reached an operator's page and the logs as a SQL dump, which is the same disclosure
 * shape as a leaked credential one layer out, and it left `lastError` holding whatever was there
 * before: stale, or null, on a refresh that had in fact failed.
 *
 * FIXED BY NOT REACHING THE DATABASE WITH IT, rather than by catching it better. A vendor that
 * names one action twice is answering about one action — `mcp_tools`' `(server_id, name)` primary
 * key says so, and the first listing is as good an answer as the second, so the duplicate is
 * dropped rather than made into an error somebody has to act on. A control character in a
 * description is not content anybody wants to keep either. What is left after this is a
 * transaction that fails for reasons that are genuinely not the vendor's, which is what the
 * comment on the replace has always claimed.
 *
 * FIRST OCCURRENCE WINS, and the order is the vendor's own. Anything else needs a rule for which
 * of two identical names is the real one, and there is no such rule.

 * The two things an actor field says when the actor is not a person, and they are not the same

 *

 * string. An absent field reads as absent; `""` reads as a value, so a reader grouping the trail by
 * actor gets a person called nothing, and every count of "acts by X" is quietly wrong about them.
 *
 * `deployment` is a positive answer: nobody was asking because the deployment itself acted — a
 * shared credential, a public endpoint, a refresh it ran on its own behalf immediately after an app
 * was added. `unattributed` is the opposite, and the distinction is the whole point of having two:
 * something happened that SHOULD have had a person behind it and this deployment could not say who.
 * `identifyActor` answers `{ id: "" }` for exactly that, and the run is then refused — which is
 * precisely the moment the trail is worth reading, so it must not be the moment it goes blank.
 *
 * Neither is an address, so neither can collide with a user id: every actor written here otherwise
 * is `users.id` or the email a session resolved to.
 *
 * NOT THE SAME AXIS AS `initiator_kind`, and a row carrying both is not contradicting itself.
 * `initiator_kind` answers what set a run in motion; this field answers whose account it reached
 * and who can be named for it. So `initiator_kind: "person"` beside `actor: "unattributed"` reads
 * correctly as a person-initiated request whose person this deployment could not identify. That is
 * the honest reading, and it is the reason this is NOT recorded as `deployment`: that would assert
 * the call went out on the deployment's own credential, and it did not go out at all.
 *
 * `DEPLOYMENT_INITIATOR`'s own doc claims the case of "refusing a caller it could not identify",
 * which overlaps this one and would answer it the other way. Nothing sends it there — the tool path
 * defaults its initiator to person and `identifyActor` returns an empty id rather than a deployment
 * — so the overlap is in the prose, not in the behaviour. It is left alone deliberately rather than
 * resolved by widening either vocabulary unilaterally; whoever owns that constant should narrow its

   * The token one call goes out with, and whose it is — decided from `access.credential`, so that
   * this function and the audit row cannot disagree about whose account a call ran in.
   *
   * For a `deployment-token` server this is what it always was: the one credential an administrator
   * gave the server, used for everybody. A `none` server reaches the same branch and finds nothing
   * to decrypt, which is the right answer for an endpoint that takes no credential at all.
   *
   * For a `brokered` server there is no token here AT ALL. The deployment's one key belongs to the
   * transport and never travels through this function, so nothing here can leak it into a connection
   * object, an error or an audit row. What this function contributes instead is the two refusals
   * that have to happen before a call is spent at the broker: a run nobody is attributed for, and an
   * asker who has not connected the app — so a person is told their own next step rather than shown
   * the broker's error about an account it cannot find. A third refusal sits between those two, for
   * a brokered row whose url names no Composio app; nothing in the product creates such a row, so no
   * person's situation reaches it.
   *
   * For a `person-oauth` server it is the asker's own, and every branch that cannot prove it has the
   * asker's grant refuses. There is deliberately no fallback. A fallback is the one bug this design
   * exists to make impossible: answering out of whatever the deployment, or the last person to
   * connect, happened to be able to see — which returns a confident answer assembled from documents
   * the person asking cannot open, and looks exactly like a correct answer.
   *
   * Nothing is cached on any path, and only on the `person-oauth` one is that a decision. There, the
   * refresh token is exchanged for an access token per call and the access token is thrown away, so
   * there is no stored copy of anybody's access for a disconnect to have to find. That costs a round
   * trip to the vendor's token endpoint on every call, which is the price of revocation being
   * complete by construction rather than by cleanup. The other two paths have nothing to cache: a
   * `deployment-token` is decrypted out of the vault per call, and a `brokered` key is never held
   * here at all.

       * ONE SMALL READ PER BROKERED CALL, which is the price of that. `mcp_servers` holds one row

       * operator picks up a vendor's change without removing and re-adding the app. The second
       * clause was false, for one reason: {@link ComposioBroker.ensureAuthConfig} REUSES a config of
       * ours whatever scheme it holds and creates nothing, so a press of Add does not pick the
       * vendor's change up — it records a word beside a config that never moved. An app enabled as
       * `API_KEY` and given managed OAuth by the vendor came out of that press recording `OAUTH2`

       * repair it, because the reuse is the cause.
       *

       * connection is moved by the write; a config this call actually CREATED means there is a
       * config that was made as the word being written. `standing` writes nothing whatever the
       * connection count, and remove-and-re-add is then the one act that genuinely changes an app's
       * scheme, because it is the one that deletes the config.

     * A THIRD KIND OF ACCESS THAT IS NOT A SECRET. A brokered app holds no per-person secret at all

       * saying it had happened. Consent that reattaches by itself is not consent.
       *
       * KEYED ON THE APP THE URL NAMES, exactly as `connectionTokenFor` keys the gate. `row.id` is a
       * display key and nothing holds it equal to the slug in the url, so a delete by id would clear
       * some other app's connections, or none, for the very row shape that gate already refuses to
       * trust. `accessFor` is asked rather than the url parsed here, so this cannot drift from it.
       *
       * ASKED WITH NO ENTRY, deliberately, and that is not the entry-wins order being dodged. An
       * entry can only ever SUPPRESS this answer — `accessFor` returns a null toolkit for every row
       * that has one — so passing the entry a colliding id looks up would hide the brokered state of
       * the one row most in need of clearing, and would now refuse outright the very row this method
       * exists to get rid of, leaving the collision unremovable. Nothing is dialled here, so there is
       * no vendor for an entry to protect; the only question is which app's consent rows this row's
       * own url stands for.
       *
       * Before the server row goes, for the reason the revokes above are: what a failure between
       * two writes leaves has to be the recoverable half. A connection cleared with the app still
       * present is fixed by removing it again; an app deleted with the connections standing is
       * reachable by no operation at all, because the toolkit was only ever readable off its url.
       *
       * AND THE ACCOUNT IS ENDED AT THE VENDOR, not merely forgotten here. Deleting the row closes
       * the gate this deployment owns and does nothing whatever to the account: the person's
       * mailbox stays attached at Composio, the grant stays live, and an administrator who pressed
       * "remove" was told the connector was gone. So every connected person is revoked through the
       * broker first, exactly as {@link disconnectBrokered} revokes for one — the same
       * shape at the scale of an app.
       *
       * REVOKE BEFORE DELETE, ALWAYS, and the argument is the one that method makes. The row is the
       * only thing here that names which app this person connected, so a delete that ran first
       * would leave a failed revoke with nothing to revoke under: a live grant on somebody's
       * mailbox that no operation in this deployment can reach. The other order costs a repeat of
       * an administrative act nobody minds repeating. Dead and reachable beats live and
       * unreachable.
       *
       * WHICH MAKES THE FAILURE LOUD. Nothing is caught around the revokes: a broker that will not
       * answer ends this method with the rows still standing and the app still present, rather than
       * letting it report an ending that did not happen.
       *
       * THE AUTH CONFIG GOES LAST, after every account is dead and every row is gone, for the same
       * reasoning one step out. An orphaned auth config grants nobody anything — it is a shape this
       * deployment holds at Composio, not an account — while a live account whose config has
       * already been deleted is access that nothing left here can end.

     * WHY IT EXISTS BESIDE {@link listServers}. Three routes asked that one for a single row's url
     * — the brokered branch of connect, and the confirm and disconnect pair behind
     * `brokeredAppFor` — and it answers by running three queries and materialising every server,
     * every tool and every grant in the deployment. Confirm is the sharp end: both brokered account
     * screens call it from an effect on mount, so opening a large app's page read the whole tool and
     * grant table to ask whether one row is brokered. None of the three looks at a tool or a grant.
     *
     * THE URL IS THE ROW'S OWN, read out of the column rather than composed from the id. The whole
     * brokered feature rests on the two being allowed to differ: `addBrokeredApp` writes
     * `composio://<slug>` and names the row for it, but nothing holds them equal afterwards, and a
     * row called `gmail` at `composio://slack` is exactly the shape the connection gate was once
     * keyed on the wrong half of. The catalogue reconciliation {@link effectiveUrl} applies for
     * `listServers` is deliberately not applied here, and changes no answer: it only ever
     * substitutes the pinned host of a first-party entry, and neither reading of such a row names a
     * Composio app.
     *
     * `undefined` for an id naming no row, which is what the `.find` over the whole list answered
     * before — so a route that refused an unknown id still refuses it, in the same words.

     * AND THE SCHEME IS THE APP'S, NOT THIS ROW'S, WHICH IS THE ONE FIELD HERE THAT IS NOT ABOUT A
     * ROW AT ALL.

     * CRITERION. For a row whose url names a Composio app, `authScheme` is what
     * {@link brokeredAppScheme} answers for that app.
     *
     * REASON. The connect route forks on this field — a form for a key app, a consent link for a
     * consent one, a refusal for a no-auth one — and the store method that fork leads to,
     * {@link connectBrokeredWithFields}, reads the scheme off the row that answers for the APP. Two
     * rows may name one app, so those were two different reads of one fact: the page draws a form
     * off this row and the submission is refused by the other row's scheme, in a sentence telling
     * somebody to connect an app the way it asks for — over an app they were just asked exactly
     * that way. The id and the title stay this row's own, because those name the row the page
     * opened; the scheme is a fact about the app, and the app has one answer.

    /**
     * Which brokered apps this person has connected, for the same settings page.
     *
     * A SECOND METHOD RATHER THAN A WIDER {@link connectionsFor}, because the two answer out of
     * different tables for a reason the schema is built on: a `user-oauth` connection is a pointer
     * into the vault, and a brokered one holds no secret at all because Composio keeps the account
     * (see {@link brokeredConnection}). Reading only the vault side is what left a brokered
     * connection invisible to the browser, so the settings screen could not honestly say whether
     * somebody was connected.
     *
     * THE SERVER ID IS JOINED, NOT SPELLED. `addBrokeredApp` writes the app into the url, and every
     * later call resolves against that url — so matching on it asks the row what it is, where
     * composing `composio-${toolkit}` by hand would re-derive the id from a convention nothing
     * holds it to. It is the reasoning the directory route already uses when it reads a row's
     * toolkit off its url rather than off its id. An app this deployment has since removed
     * therefore drops out of the answer, which is the honest result: there is no server row left
     * for a page to name.
     *
     * `scope` IS EMPTY for the reason {@link confirmBrokeredConnection} sets out: Composio grants
     * none that it tells us about, and the field exists to record what the vendor said it granted
     * rather than what we suppose. It is returned all the same, so the fields this shares with
     * {@link connectionsFor} — `serverId`, `scope`, `connectedAt` — line up and one screen can draw
     * both kinds of row. What comes back here is a SUPERSET of that shape rather than the same one:
     * `verified` and `verifiedAt` ride along too, and only on a brokered row, because only a
     * brokered row is a thing this deployment can re-check.
     *
     * `verified` AND `verifiedAt` COME ALONG BECAUSE "connected" IS NOT A PRESENT TENSE HERE.
     * Composio never re-checks a key somebody typed in: it answers ACTIVE for as long as the row
     * exists, whatever the vendor on the other side now thinks of that credential. So a page drawn
     * off `connectedAt` alone would assert something this deployment has not known since the day it
     * was written. These two fields are what lets it say when the claim was last earned instead —
     * "connected with a key you provided, last checked 13 Sep". What the pair separates is a
     * CHECKED key connection from an unchecked one, and nothing more: which KIND of connection a
     * row is comes from the app's recorded {@link ServerRecord.authScheme}, which the page branches
     * on first, and not from anything answered here.
     *
     * `probe` IS THE ACTION THE LAST CHECK SPENT, READ OUT OF THE ROW. The pair above says whether a
     * key connection was ever checked; it cannot say WHY one was not, and three different
     * situations share the one word `false`. Until this field, only the answer to a connect or a
     * re-check could tell them apart — so a page reload lost the distinction, and the worst of the
     * three degraded into the mildest: a row saying the key was accepted without being checked, over
     * an account whose key the vendor had actually REFUSED.
     *
     * IT IS STORED BECAUSE IT IS A FACT ABOUT A MOMENT, NOT ABOUT TODAY'S METADATA. This field was
     * once derived here, by asking {@link probeActionFor} which action this deployment WOULD check
     * the app with; the argument for that was that the chooser holds every condition the probe
     * itself runs on, so the two could not disagree. They cannot disagree AT AN INSTANT, and that is
     * all it establishes. `verified` records a check made against the app's action listing as it
     * stood THEN, and the chooser answers from the listing as it stands NOW — and `POST
     * /servers/:id/refresh` is a generic administrator's route keyed on a server id, of which
     * `composio-<slug>` is one, so an ordinary press of Refresh moves the second without touching
     * the first. It is the very press the Composio transport tells an operator to make when an
     * action appears or gains the version that makes it callable. So: somebody connects a key to an
     * app that publishes nothing safe to try it on, and the row honestly says the key was accepted
     * unchecked. An administrator presses Refresh. From that page load on, the derivation named an
     * action, and the row drew the sentence written for a REFUSED key — your key was checked against
     * this app and rejected, the account it was checked in still stands, so disconnect it. Every
     * clause of that is false for somebody whose key was never tried, it tells them to take down a
     * connection that works, and it persists: it is what every page load says until they press
     * Re-check.
     *
     * SO THE WRITER RECORDS WHAT IT SPENT AND THIS READS IT BACK. {@link recordBrokeredConnection}
     * is the single writer, every path into it knows the action it spent or that it spent none, and
     * {@link composioConnections.probeAction} is where that goes. Read together with `verified`, the
     * column tells four states apart, and no inference is made in any of them:
     *
     *   no probe, not verified   — nothing was tried: at the time of the check the app published
     *                              nothing safe to spend a key on. A fact about the app, not the
     *                              key. A key row written before the column existed reads this way
     *                              too, for the reason that column gives.
     *   no probe, verified       — a CONSENT connection. The vendor's own yes at its own screen is
     *                              the evidence, no call was ever made against the account, and so
     *                              there is no action to name.
     *   a probe, verified        — it ran in this person's account and the vendor took the key.
     *   a probe, NOT verified    — it ran and the vendor refused the key, and the account it ran in
     *                              is still standing. A live account with a bad key behind it.
     *
     * AND THE LAST LINE IS A RECORD RATHER THAN AN INFERENCE, which is the whole of what changed.
     * The caveat that stood here used to argue the state into existence: a key connection is ALWAYS
     * probed at connect time, a probe that fails withdraws the account it just made, so an
     * unverified row under an app that HAS a probe must be a refusal whose withdrawal failed — or
     * else a re-check the vendor refused, which leaves the person's own older account alone. That
     * reasoning was sound about the rows it described and said nothing about the row a refresh had
     * quietly moved underneath it. What the row now warrants, it warrants by having been written:
     * the check ran, it spent this action, and the vendor refused.
     *
     * WHICH PATH WROTE IT IS STILL NOT RECOVERABLE, and a reader must not invent one. The column
     * records what was spent, not who spent it, and the two writers of that pair end differently: a
     * connect withdraws the account it had just made and only leaves the row where Composio refused
     * to take it back, while a re-check never withdraws anything, because the account predates the
     * press and is the person's own. So a page may say the key was refused and the account stands;
     * a page that goes on to blame a failed withdrawal is right on the connect path and FALSE on the
     * re-check, where nothing ever tried to remove anything.
     *
     * `checkable` IS THE OTHER QUESTION, AND IT TRAVELS SEPARATELY BECAUSE COLLAPSING THE TWO IS
     * WHAT DEADLOCKED THE SETTINGS SCREEN. "What did the check SPEND" is a fact about the past, and
     * `probe` answers it. "Does this app have anything to check with TODAY" is a fact about the
     * present, and this answers that — out of {@link probeActionFor}, asked of the APP rather than
     * of the connection. The two agreed for as long as `probe` was derived: one field, one moment,
     * two questions nobody ever had to tell apart. They part company the instant it became a
     * record, which is the same instant it started being right about the past.
     *
     * THE DEADLOCK IN FULL, BECAUSE IT DOES NOT SELF-HEAL. The page gates its Re-check button on
     * whether there is anything to check with, and it read `probe` for that. Somebody connects a
     * key to an app that publishes nothing safe to spend it on: the check spends nothing, the row
     * records null, and both of those are correct and permanent. An administrator presses Refresh,
     * the app gains a safe versioned read, and the button is STILL withheld — because the record
     * still says, truthfully, that nothing was spent. And pressing that button is the only thing in
     * this product that can ever put an action into the record. The state is stable, wrong, and
     * unreachable from inside itself: the single act that would end it is the act being withheld.
     *
     * SO A CALLER TAKES THE PAST FROM ONE AND THE PRESENT FROM THE OTHER, and must take neither out
     * of the other one. A screen drawing its SENTENCE off `checkable` would accuse a key nobody
     * tried, which is the defect the recorded column was made for; a screen gating its BUTTON on
     * `probe` is the deadlock above. Neither field is a weaker spelling of the other, and the
     * moment one is asked to answer both questions the two failures simply trade places.
     *
     * WHICH COSTS ONE QUERY PER CONNECTED APP, AND THAT IS THE RIGHT PRICE. Making `probe` a stored
     * column took the per-row call out and left a listing that was one query; this puts it back —
     * on top of the two the rows themselves now take, which the body below says why.
     * The alternative is to fold the chooser's rule into the join — vendor-labelled read, not
     * destructive, no required inputs, a recorded version — and that rule has no honest spelling in
     * SQL: `required` is the vendor's own JSON Schema stored unchanged, and deciding whether it is
     * a non-empty list of names is a thing JavaScript does and a `json` operator does badly. So
     * folding it in means writing the rule a SECOND time, in a second language, over the same rows,
     * and this file already records what a rule in two places costs: while the version condition
     * sat in one of them, an app whose chosen action had no version connected honestly as "nothing
     * was tried" and reloaded as "your key was checked and rejected". {@link probeActionFor} is the
     * one authority on what can be checked, and a listing that asks it N times cannot disagree with
     * the probe that asks it once. N is the apps ONE person has connected — a handful of indexed
     * reads by server id, made in parallel — behind a settings page and not on any hot path.
     *
     * `verifiedAt` STAYS NULL WHERE IT IS NULL, unlike `connectedAt`, which collapses to `""`
     * because a row cannot exist without one and the fallback is unreachable. Null here is
     * reachable and it means something: never checked. Folding it into `""` would hand the page a
     * row that was checked at a time nobody recorded, which is a different fact and not one this
     * table ever holds. Note also what {@link composioConnections.verified} sets out about the rows
     * migration 0038 backfilled: their `verifiedAt` is the moment of consent, not the moment of a
     * probe, so a caller must not read every timestamp here as "this connection answered then".

       * THE APP IS RESOLVED PER CONNECTION, NOT JOINED TO IT, BECAUSE THE URL IS NOT A KEY.
       *
       * CRITERION. One connection is one row out of here, whatever `mcp_servers` holds.
       *
       * REASON. This read used to be an inner join on `mcp_servers.url = 'composio://' || toolkit`,
       * and nothing in the schema makes that column unique — the one `uniqueIndex` in
       * `db/schema/plugins.ts` is `skills_slug_key` on `skills.slug`. A join answers one row per
       * PAIR, so a second row at an app's url listed the same account twice: two rows on the
       * settings page saying the same app under two different server ids, each offering to
       * disconnect the single connection standing behind both. And it is not an exotic state — it
       * is what any database looks like the moment a row at `gmail` sits beside the
       * `composio-gmail` an administrator really added, which is how a development database
       * routinely looks.
       *
       * A UNIQUE INDEX WOULD BE THE OTHER FIX AND IS THE WRONG ONE. Two rows at one address is a
       * state this product means to allow — a deployment holding two accounts at one vendor adds
       * the same URL twice under two ids with two credentials, and `addCustomServer` refuses only a
       * re-add that MOVES an existing id's address. Constraining the column would forbid that for
       * everybody to tidy a display defect, and the migration that added it would fail outright on
       * any deployment already holding a duplicate, taking the whole boot with it.
       *
       * SO THE LOWER ID ANSWERS FOR THE APP, and it is a rule rather than whatever the scan met
       * first: a page that redrew under a different `serverId` each load would be offering buttons
       * keyed on a value moving underneath it. The same rule decides the scheme reads — see
       * {@link brokeredAppScheme} — so nothing in this file can name one row for an app while
       * something else names another.
       *
       * AND "LOWER" IS THE DATABASE'S OWN WORD FOR IT, WHICH IS WHY THE ORDER IS IN THE QUERY. This
       * read took its rows unordered and picked the smallest with a JavaScript `<`, which compares
       * UTF-16 code units and nothing else, while {@link brokeredAppRow} asks for `order by id`
       * under whatever collation the deployment's database runs. Those two agree for ASCII on a `C`
       * database and are free to disagree everywhere else — a linguistic collation reorders case and
       * punctuation, and byte order and code-unit order part company above the BMP. One rule spelled
       * in two languages is two rules, and where they parted the page drew an app under one server
       * id while the Re-check button beside it, the probe behind that button and the scheme that
       * decides whether the button appears at all were about the other row: the same defect the
       * single read was written to end, reached through the collation instead of through the query.
       * So the resolution is {@link brokeredAppRowsAt} and not a rule spelled again here: it is the
       * same function {@link brokeredAppRow} answers one app out of, which is what makes the row
       * this page draws an app under the row every read behind its buttons is about.
       *
       * A CONNECTION WITH NO ROW AT ITS URL IS STILL LISTED BY NOTHING, which is what the inner
       * join answered and what the missing `serverId` below drops. A person can hold an account at
       * an app this deployment has since removed, and the settings page has no row to draw for it.

     * safety conditions below are BOTH non-negotiable, and neither is a stricter spelling of the
     * other.
     *
     * READ EFFECT, because a probe must not change anything. The label is the vendor's own and not
     * a guess of ours: `effectOf` answers `read` only where Composio sent `readOnlyHint`, and
     * everything unlabelled was already recorded as a write, so `read` here means Stripe or Linear
     * or Notion said so. `destructive` is checked beside it rather than trusted to be implied — the
     * two are separate columns precisely so a vendor can say both things, and a row that somehow
     * says read AND destructive is a row this deployment has no business calling unasked.
     *
     * ZERO REQUIRED INPUTS, because there is nothing to invent an argument from. A probe happens
     * before this deployment knows anything about the account beyond the key, so a required customer
     * id or query has no honest value to carry, and a made-up one turns "is this key good" into
     * "does this identifier exist" — which fails for a perfectly good key.
     *
     * BOTH, NEVER EITHER, and the live catalogue is why this sentence is here rather than a comment
     * saying the checks are belt-and-braces. The first argument-less action on Stripe's own list is
     * `STRIPE_CREATE_BILLING_METER_EVENT_SESSION`. A probe chosen on "takes no arguments" alone —
     * the condition that looks sufficient, because it is the one that makes a call possible at all —
     * would therefore write to somebody's account to find out whether their key works. The read
     * effect is the whole of what stands between those two names.
     *
     * AND A RECORDED VERSION, WHICH IS PART OF "CAN THIS BE CALLED AT ALL" AND NOT A DETAIL OF THE
     * CALLER. Composio refuses an execution without a specific version and rejects `latest`, so the
     * transport refuses before dialling where none travels with the call — and Composio publishes
     * some actions with no version at all. An action this deployment recorded without one is
     * therefore an action nothing here can spend a key on, which is the same kind of fact as a
     * required input: not unsafe, just not callable. The version is SELECTED AND RETURNED for the
     * caller that has to send it, so the choice and the call cannot come apart.
     *
     * THE CONDITION LIVES IN THE FILTER RATHER THAN AFTER THE CHOICE, so there is ONE predicate for
     * one question. While it sat downstream — read by the probe, unknown to everything else — there
     * were two, and the weaker of them was what the connections listing derived its `probe` field
     * from: an app whose chosen action had no version connected honestly as "nothing was tried",
     * then reloaded as "your key was checked and rejected". That listing no longer derives that
     * field from here — {@link brokeredConnectionsFor} reads what the check RECORDED, because no
     * derivation from today's metadata can be right about yesterday's check. It still asks this
     * function a question, but a present-tense one: whether the app has anything to check with now,
     * kept as a yes or no beside the record. A split predicate would therefore no longer put a
     * false sentence on a settings page; it would show up in two worse places — a probe that chose
     * an action it then refused to send, and a button offered over an app nothing can be spent on.
     * A filter also lets the search CONTINUE: a versionless
     * candidate is passed over for the next safe read rather than short-circuiting the whole app to
     * "nothing to try", so an app that can be checked is.
     *
     * NULL IS AN ANSWER AND NOT A FAILURE. Of fifteen key-based apps sampled, most publish some safe
     * argument-less read and PostHog publishes none at all, so an app that cannot be probed is an
     * ordinary app rather than a broken one. What a caller does about it — and running the probe at

     * without the moment it was earned, and `verified_at` without the flag is a date on a claim
     * nobody made. Every path that records a connection therefore comes through here rather than
     * spelling that set for itself — {@link confirmBrokeredConnection} with `true` today, and the
     * verify path, which is the caller `false` exists for, when a probe against a key connection
     * comes back unanswered. Two call sites each writing the set by hand is how one of them comes
     * to set the flag and leave the timestamp null, or to move `connected_at` on a confirm that
     * healed a row nothing changed; spelled once, a reader asking what shape a connection row takes
     * has one answer and every path takes it.
     *
     * `verified` IS THE CALLER'S CLAIM AND `verifiedAt` FOLLOWS FROM IT, never the other way round.
     * True means the caller has evidence as of now — the vendor's own yes at the end of a consent
     * screen, or a call that went out and came back — so the timestamp is stamped here rather than
     * passed in, and it is the moment of the write because that is the moment the evidence was in
     * hand. False takes the timestamp back to null rather than leaving the old one standing: a row
     * that has stopped being verified must not keep a date saying when it last was, because the one
     * sentence the page builds out of the pair — "last checked 13 Sep" — would then be drawn for a
     * connection this deployment is no longer claiming anything about.
     *
     * `connected_at` IS LEFT ALONE, which is the whole reason this is an upsert with an explicit
     * `set` rather than a delete and an insert. The person connected when they connected; a write
     * that moved it would make every page load look like a fresh connection on their own settings
     * page, and would erase the one date the row holds that nothing else in this deployment knows.
     *
     * AND THE STAMP IT WROTE IS WHAT IT ANSWERS, for the same reason the caller does not pass one
     * in. A caller that needs the moment — {@link recheckBrokeredConnection}, which hands it to the
     * browser as the date the row's sentence is drawn from — would otherwise have to read the row
     * back and hope it was reading its own write. The timestamp is still this writer's; what
     * changed is that it is no longer thrown away.
     *
     * `only` IS WHETHER THIS WRITE MAY CREATE A CONNECTION, AND ONE CALLER MUST SAY NO.
     *
     * CRITERION. With `only: "a row that is still there"` this method never inserts. It updates a
     * row that exists and answers `wrote: false` for one that does not, and the caller decides what
     * to do about that.
     *
     * REASON. {@link recheckBrokeredConnection} reads the row first, deliberately, "because the
     * writer below is an upsert, so a re-check that probed first would INSERT a connection for
     * somebody who has none". That read and this write straddle a LIVE VENDOR CALL of several
     * seconds, and nothing held the row still across it. A person pressing Re-check and then
     * Disconnect in another tab — or a concurrent {@link confirmBrokeredConnection} getting `false`
     * from Composio and deleting the row — had the revoke complete at Composio and the row deleted,
     * and then this in-flight upsert PUT IT BACK. `composio_connections` is the whole of the
     * permission a brokered call is decided on, so what the re-insert restores is access to an
     * account the person has just disconnected, drawn on every screen as connected.
     *
     * THE GUARD IS ON THE WRITE RATHER THAN A LOCK ACROSS THE CALL, because the call is somebody
     * else's and may take as long as it likes. A connection this write did not find is one nothing
     * happened to: the probe's answer is about an account the person no longer has here.
     *
     * `probeAction` IS PASSED IN, UNLIKE THE TIMESTAMP, BECAUSE ONLY THE CALLER KNOWS IT. It is the
     * action this check SPENT — the probe's name, or null where none was spent — and it is required
     * rather than optional so that a new path cannot record a connection while staying silent about
     * what it tried. Every existing caller knows the answer without looking anything up: a consent
     * confirm spent nothing and passes null, and both probing paths pass the name the probe returned
     * them, which is null there too when the app published nothing safe to call.
     *
     * IT IS PART OF THE SAME SET AS THE FLAG AND THE STAMP, which is the reason it is written here
     * and nowhere else. `verified` alone says a check did not pass and cannot say what it was; this
     * column is what separates "the app published nothing to try" from "it ran and the vendor said
     * no", and a row carrying one of the three without the others is a shape no reader downstream
     * has reasoned about. It used to be derived on read instead, from the app's action listing as
     * that listing stood at the moment of the read — see {@link brokeredConnectionsFor}, where the

     * ONE PROBE, TWO CALLERS, AND THE ANSWER TO "WHAT DOES A FAILED PROBE MEAN" LIVES HERE ONCE.
     * {@link connectBrokeredWithFields} probes a key somebody has just typed;
     * {@link recheckBrokeredConnection} probes one this deployment has held for days. Both have to
     * choose the action the same way, send it the same way, and read the vendor's answer the same
     * way — and a second copy of that reading is how one of them comes to treat a rejected key as a
     * connection that merely could not be checked. What the two callers do NEXT is all that differs,
     * and it is all either of them keeps for itself: one withdraws the account it just made, the
     * other leaves an account it did not make alone.
     *
     * FOUR ANSWERS AND NOT A BOOLEAN, because `verified: false` means several different things
     * about somebody's key and the flag separates none of them. They are enumerated on
     * {@link BrokeredProbe}, which is where a reader should go; the one worth repeating at the call
     * this method makes is the fourth.
     *
     * A VENDOR THAT WAS NOT REACHED IS NOT A VENDOR THAT SAID NO, and this is the one place that
     * can tell. `callTool` answers with a result rather than throwing, and `isError` is true for all
     * three of the failures it documents — so read as a verdict here, a Composio outage, a socket
     * that closed, a `@composio/core` that cannot parse what came back and a run attributed to
     * nobody were every one of them "the vendor refused this key". What that cost is at the callers
     * and it was the worst thing this feature did: on connect the account somebody had just made
     * was deleted at the vendor and they were told what they entered did not work; on re-check a
     * live, working connection was stripped of its verification and marked as holding a bad key.
     * {@link ActionAnswer} is what the transport now answers beside the result, and this method
     * asks for it by calling `askAction` rather than `callTool`.
     *
     * A FAILURE IS RETURNED RATHER THAN THROWN, which is the one thing this function does not
     * decide. Its two callers end a bad key differently — one undoes an account and refuses, the
     * other writes the row unverified and refuses — so a throw here would force the undo on both or
     * neither. What it owes them is the vendor's sentence and the name of what was tried.
     *
     * NOTHING IS WRITTEN, NOTHING IS AUDITED, AND NO ACCOUNT IS TOUCHED. This is a question asked of
     * the vendor; recording the answer belongs to whoever asked it.

       * that the credential works — and a row written on that acceptance is a gate every later
       * brokered call passes for a key that cannot answer. {@link probeActionFor} is what keeps the
       * call safe: the vendor must have labelled the action a read and it must take no arguments,
       * and both matter because the first argument-less action on Stripe's own list creates a
       * billing session. It answers the VERSION beside the name, because Composio refuses an
       * execution without a specific one — so an action recorded without a version is one the
       * chooser passes over rather than one this method discovers it cannot call. Null is an
       * ordinary answer — see that method — and it is the FIRST of the three states above.
       *
       * NOTHING IS ASKED A SECOND TIME HERE, AND THAT IS THE POINT. Every condition on whether an
       * action can be spent on a key lives in the chooser, so the action this method sends is the
       * action the chooser said was sendable, whole. A version re-read here would be a second
       * predicate for one question, and the weaker of two predicates is what once had a reloaded
       * page tell somebody their untried key had been rejected — in the days when the connections
       * listing answered by asking the chooser too. It no longer does: what a page says about a
       * check is what the check recorded, and what it recorded is the name this method returns.
       *
       * AND THE APP IS RESOLVED BY ITS URL, THE WAY EVERY OTHER BROKERED LOOKUP HERE IS — through
       * {@link brokeredAppRow}, which is the one read that decides it. The url is where a brokered
       * row records which app it is; `mcp_servers.id` is a display name and nothing holds the two
       * equal — which is exactly why {@link connectBrokeredWithFields}, {@link
       * recheckBrokeredConnection} and {@link disconnectBrokered} all key on the url, and why {@link
       * brokeredConnectionsFor} resolves on it rather than spelling `composio-${toolkit}` by hand.
       * Composing it here made this method the one place that re-derived the id from a convention,
       * and it put the two halves of the `checkable`/`probe` split back into disagreement on any
       * row where they differ: the listing answered `checkable` off the app's real row while this
       * answered off an id addressing nothing, so the button was offered and the press could never
       * find anything to spend — the Re-check deadlock the split exists to prevent, reached from
       * the other end. Worse where the composed id DID hit something: a row called `composio-gmail`
       * at `composio://slack` would have this choose a stranger's probe off another app's listing
       * and spend their key on it. A row this deployment has since removed drops out here as null,
       * which is the same honest answer the listing gives for it: there is no app left to check.
       *
       * AND THE SHARED READ RATHER THAN A URL QUERY OF ITS OWN, because `mcp_servers.url` has no
       * unique index and an unordered `limit(1)` over it is not an answer. A second row at the app's
       * url — the ordinary state of any database where a fixture sits beside the `composio-` row an
       * administrator really added — had this resolve to whichever row the scan met first while the
       * listing named the app by the lower id, which is the SAME deadlock one step along: Re-check
       * offered off the app's own row, and the press landing on a row that publishes no action and
       * reporting there was nothing to try. One function decides which row answers for an app, so

     * the vendor's own error about a connection it cannot find, at the moment a Bot was asked to do
     * something.
     *
     * SO THE ANSWER NO LEAVES NO ROW BEHIND. `false` from {@link ComposioBroker.isConnected} is a
     * positive claim that there is no account, and the honest local state for that claim is an
     * absence — so a row already sitting here is deleted rather than left standing. Leaving it
     * would have the settings list go on drawing "Connected" for an account nobody has, and would
     * go on passing the gate every later brokered call is decided on, while the app's own detail
     * page asks the vendor and says the opposite.
     *
     * AND THAT DELETION FILES NO TRAIL ENTRY. Nobody disconnected anything here: the grant ended
     * somewhere else, and this is our record catching up with a fact. {@link disconnectBrokered}
     * owns `mcp.account_disconnected` and files it for the act it performed; a second filer here
     * would have the trail claim an act that did not happen, credited to whichever page load
     * happened to notice.
     *
     * UPSERT RATHER THAN INSERT, keyed on the pair the table itself is keyed on. This is safe to
     * call repeatedly and is meant to be: because the row is only a cache of the vendor's answer
     * (see {@link brokeredConnection}), a row that drifted out of step — an account ended in
     * Composio's own dashboard, a connect this deployment missed the callback for — is healed by
     * the next confirm on any page load, in whichever direction it drifted: by the upsert here
     * where the vendor says yes, and by the delete above where it says no.
     *
     * AND THE YES WRITES A VERDICT ONLY WHERE CONSENT IS THE CHECK, which is the one thing a reader
     * of this method has to carry away. `verified: true` beside a null `probeAction` is not a
     * neutral heal: it is a NAMED one of the four states {@link composioConnections.probeAction}
     * enumerates — the consent state — and this method runs from an effect on mount, so writing it
     * unconditionally meant every page load restated it over whatever a real check had recorded.
     * For a key connection that erased the record, worst of all over "a named probe beside
     * `verified: false`", the live account with a bad key behind it that is the one state somebody
     * must act on; and it re-dated `verified_at` to the page load, so the row claimed a check on a
     * day nothing was checked. The yes itself does not bear on a key: {@link
     * ComposioBroker.isConnected} says an account is attached, Composio takes a key when it is
     * typed and never tests it again, so for a key app that answer is what the row's existence
     * already said. The branch is on the scheme recorded on the app's row, classified through {@link
     * brokeredAppKind} as {@link connectBrokeredWithFields} and {@link recheckBrokeredConnection}
     * classify theirs, and a key row already here is left untouched — the evidence about a key is a
     * call, and those two are the only writers of this row's verdict. A key app the vendor holds an
     * account for with no row here still gets one, written UNCHECKED, because the row is the gate
     * every later brokered call passes through and the only thing Disconnect works off.
     *
     * AND THE FLAG IS WRITTEN FOR A CONSENT APP RATHER THAN FOR ANYTHING THAT IS NOT A KEY APP. A
     * scheme this deployment cannot read — a null, or a literal nothing here writes — is neither
     * kind, and it takes the key app's treatment: nothing recorded is overwritten, and a person the
     * vendor holds an account for still gets the row that is their permission. See {@link
     * SchemeKind} for why that third answer has to travel rather than be flattened into the second.
     *
     * `scope` IS EMPTY BECAUSE COMPOSIO GRANTS NONE THAT IT TELLS US ABOUT. The field exists so a
     * later refusal for want of a permission can be explained by what the vendor actually granted,
     * and Composio's connection answer is a boolean with no scope in it. Writing a plausible claim
     * there — the app's full access, say — would put words in the vendor's mouth in the one field
     * whose whole job is to say what it said.
     *
     * `reconnected` IS FALSE FOR THE SAME REASON, and trivially so. The flag distinguishes somebody
     * replacing a grant from somebody making one, and the only confirms that reach the trail are
     * the ones that found no row at all — so there was nothing here to replace.
     *
     * AND THE EVENT IS WRITTEN ONLY WHERE THE ROW IS NEW. This method runs on every page load
     * rather than only when a person acts, so an event per yes from the vendor would file ten
     * "account connected" rows for somebody who opened the connector page ten times having
     * connected once. A confirm that heals a row nothing changed is a read, and the trail records
     * acts: where a row was already there the connection has been recorded once already, by the
     * confirm that first found none.

       * that an account is attached, which for a key app is what the row's existence already said:
       * Composio takes a key when it is typed and never tests it again — the whole reason the probe

       * this row's verdict. This one records what it learned by not writing.
       *

       * row above, which is what a confirm on a key app is still worth running for.
       *
       * AND AN EXISTING ROW UNDER AN UNREADABLE SCHEME IS LEFT ALONE FOR A STRICTLY WIDER REASON.

       * not known WHAT the yes is evidence of. Both answers are the same act — write nothing — and

     * Composio. Nothing else here is given them: not the row, not the audit payload, not a log
     * line, not a thrown error — the broker's own doc comment is where that promise is kept on the
     * far side, and it is the one call in this tree that rethrows with no `cause` precisely because
     * the vendor's error object holds the key. Every other participant in this method is a
     * long-lived, widely-readable record, so a credential landing in one is not a leak somebody can
     * clean up afterwards; it is a leak with a retention schedule.
     *
     * THE SCHEME IS THE ONE RECORDED ON THE APP'S ROW, never a fresh read of the catalogue and
     * never a value a caller passed. It is what this deployment's authorization config was created
     * AS, and a connection is attached to that config: a second derivation is a second answer — a
     * key sent as `BASIC` against a config made for `API_KEY` — which is the reasoning {@link
     * ComposioBroker.connectionFields} gives for taking the scheme rather than resolving it, one
     * step earlier in the same flow.
     *
     * AND AN APP WHOSE SCHEME IS NOT A FIELD SCHEME IS REFUSED BEFORE THE KEY TRAVELS. A consent
     * app, a `NO_AUTH` app and an app this deployment could not resolve at all have no form and
     * nothing to attach typed values to, so sending them on would spend somebody's credential on a
     * config that cannot hold it — and would do it having already taken the secret out of the
     * request. {@link isFieldScheme} is asked rather than the string compared, for the reason it
     * exists: one list, read by the guard and by the type, so the schemes this admits cannot come
     * apart from the schemes the broker's signature takes.
     *
     * `connected` IS THE LITERAL `true` BECAUSE THERE IS NO OTHER WAY OUT OF HERE. Unlike {@link
     * confirmBrokeredConnection}, which asks a question the vendor may answer no to, this performs
     * an act: it either made the connection or it threw. A `boolean` would invite a caller to
     * branch on a `false` this method cannot produce.
     *
     * `probe` IS RETURNED BESIDE `verified` BECAUSE THE FLAG ALONE NOW MEANS THREE DIFFERENT THINGS,
     * AND THE BROWSER READS THIS FIELD TO CHOOSE ITS SENTENCE. While the row was written `false`
     * unconditionally the flag had one meaning — nobody has checked — and a screen could say so from
     * the flag alone. With a probe that can fail there are three states, and two of them share the
     * flag:
     *
     *   null probe, `verified: false`   — nothing was tried, so nothing is known about the key.
     *                                     Either this app publishes nothing safe to call, or the
     *                                     check could not be made — Composio unreachable, or an
     *                                     answer this deployment could not read. "It was accepted
     *                                     without being checked" is true of both, which is why
     *                                     they share the state; `checkable` on the listing is what
     *                                     tells the person whether pressing Re-check can ever help,
     *                                     and the trail carries the outage under `unreachable`.
     *   named probe, `verified: true`   — the action ran in this person's account and answered.
     *   named probe, `verified: false`  — it ran, the vendor said no, and the account could not be
     *                                     withdrawn. The key is BAD and the row exists anyway.
     *
     * That last one is the worst state this feature has, and under the old wording a person in it
     * would be told their key was never checked — when it was checked, the vendor rejected it, and
     * this deployment failed to undo the account it made. INFERRING THE STATE CLIENT-SIDE FROM
     * `verified` IS EXACTLY WHAT THIS FIELD EXISTS TO PREVENT: there is nothing in the flag that
     * separates "nothing to try" from "tried and failed", so a browser deriving a sentence from it
     * would tell one of those two people the opposite of what happened. The audit row carries the
     * same distinction under `action`, for a reader of the trail rather than of the screen.

       * one nothing else records. `action` is the null the response field is: it separates an
       * unchecked connection from a checked one, which `verified: false` alone cannot.
       *
       * THE FAILED UNDO ABOVE FILES THE SAME ROW BEFORE IT THROWS, so the worst state this feature
       * has — a live account, an unverified row, and a withdrawal the vendor refused — is no longer
       * named only in a sentence one person read once. The clean undo files nothing, and the reason
       * is written out at that branch: this trail records state that persists, and a row there
       * would cost the failed-undo row the one meaning that makes it worth reading.
       *
       * UNDER THE APP SLUG, which is the id `mcp.account_connected` above, {@link
       * confirmBrokeredConnection}, {@link disconnectBrokered} and {@link retireConnectionsFor} all
       * file under — so the two rows this method can write about one person's access to one app
       * come back in ONE query, however that access began and however it ended. This row was filed
       * under the SERVER row's id instead, on the reasoning that it is about an ACTION of a server
       * rather than about access; that is true and it cost the reader the only question anybody
       * asks this trail, which was answered half by one id and half by the other. Nothing goes with
       * the change: the server id is `composio-` and the slug, and the action is in the payload.
       *
       * AND THE OUTAGE IS NAMED HERE BECAUSE THE ROW CANNOT NAME IT. Two different things leave
       * this method with a null `action` — an app that publishes nothing safe to call, and a check
       * that could not be made — and on `composio_connections` they are one state, correctly: both
       * mean the key is unchecked, and neither says anything about the key. A reader of the TRAIL
       * is asking a different question, "was a check attempted and what became of it", and
       * `unreachable` is the whole of the difference, in Composio's own words. Present only on the
       * outage, so its absence is as informative as its value.
       *
       * AND CAPPED WHERE EVERY OTHER QUOTED FOREIGN STRING IN THIS FILE IS CAPPED, which this one
       * alone was not. `passableSentence` decides whether a candidate is worth repeating and says
       * nothing whatever about length; `askAction` then caps at `MAX_RESULT_CHARS`, which is 20_000
       * and is a bound written for a model's context window rather than for a row. So the sentence
       * arriving here can be fifty times what `refreshTools`' two `lastError` writes, the failed
       * undo's own reason a hundred lines up, and `callTool`'s two `failure` fields each allow
       * themselves — and `@composio/client` builds an `APIError` message out of an entire response
       * body, so a multi-kilobyte one is the ordinary arrival and not a contrived one.
       *
       * WHY THIS ROW AND NOT ANOTHER. `audit_events` is append-only by trigger, it is exported, and
       * it is kept for the deployment's whole retention window: a `lastError` written too long is
       * overwritten by the next refresh, and this is not. Whatever lands here cannot be cleaned up

     * Try a key this deployment already holds, because somebody pressed the button that asks.

     * A BUTTON, AND NEVER A PAGE-LOAD EFFECT. Composio never re-checks a key: it accepts one when it
     * is typed and says nothing about it again, so a row that was verified in March goes on saying
     * so after the key behind it was rotated, revoked or let expire. Nothing but this can correct
     * that — which is exactly the argument somebody will use for calling it from an effect when the
     * settings page mounts, and it is the wrong conclusion. The call this makes is spent against the
     * PERSON'S OWN rate limit at the vendor, on their account, so verifying on every render would
     * burn somebody's quota at Linear to redraw one word on a page they were only passing through.
     * {@link confirmBrokeredConnection} is the one that runs on mount, and it asks Composio a
     * question about its own records; this one goes out to the app.
     *
     * A RE-CHECK IS NOT A CONNECT, AND THE DIFFERENCE IS THE WHOLE METHOD. It runs against an
     * account that already exists: it must not create one, it must not withdraw one when the probe
     * fails — the person's account stays, it is their KEY that is wrong — and it must change
     * nothing here but the verification and its timestamp. {@link connectBrokeredWithFields} does
     * undo its account on a bad key, and it is right to: the account is a thing it had just made,
     * seconds earlier, for a key that turned out not to work. Here the account predates the press by
     * days, the person asked to have it CHECKED, and taking it away to tell them their key is wrong
     * would destroy the thing they are trying to repair. The shared probe stops short of both
     * behaviours for that reason.
     *
     * A PROBE THAT RAN AND FAILED RAISES, AND DOES NOT COME BACK AS `verified: false`. Those two
     * answers are not different spellings of one outcome. `false` is also what an app that publishes
     * nothing safe to call produces, and a row handed the flag alone cannot tell "the vendor
     * rejected your key" from "there was nothing here to try" — so it would draw the unchecked
     * sentence, and drop the Re-check button, for the one person who most needs it: somebody who has
     * just fixed their key and pressed it. The refusal carries Composio's own sentence, which is the
     * whole of what they can act on. The ONLY legitimate `verified: false` from here is the one that
     * arrives with `probe: null` saying there was nothing to check with.
     *
     * NOTHING TO PROBE WRITES NOTHING AT ALL, and answers with the row as it stands. A check that
     * could try nothing has learned nothing, and writing `false` on that would take the date off a
     * connection verified at a consent screen — a fact nothing else in this deployment records,
     * erased by a button that claims to check one. So the answer is what the row says after the
     * press, and `probe` is what says whether the press was able to try anything.
     *
     * THE ROW IS READ BEFORE THE VENDOR IS CALLED, and its absence is a refusal. The writer below is
     * an upsert, so a re-check that probed first and recorded the answer would INSERT a connection
     * for somebody who has none — the row that is the whole of the gate every later brokered call
     * passes through, created by a button that only asks a question. The probe itself would be spent
     * on an account the vendor does not hold, and would come back "no connected account found": this
     * deployment's own state, shown to somebody as though their key had been rejected.
     *
     * NO BROKER IS REFUSED BEFORE ANY OF IT, though nothing here calls the broker. The broker and the
     * transport are built from the same key, so a deployment without one has neither — and the probe
     * would come back as the transport's "Composio is not configured for this deployment", which
     * this method would otherwise report as the vendor rejecting a perfectly good key, and would
     * write the row unverified on the strength of it.
     *
     * AND A CONNECTION WITH NO KEY BEHIND IT IS REFUSED HERE RATHER THAN IN THE BROWSER. There is
     * nothing to re-check on a consent connection: the person authenticated at the vendor's own
     * screen, this deployment holds no credential of theirs, and the row's `verified_at` is the
     * date that screen earned — a fact nothing else here records. A probe spent on it would be a
     * call against their account that this method then reads as evidence about a key that does not
     * exist, and the likely failure would write `verified: false` with a null timestamp: a button
     * that claims to CHECK a connection, destroying the only record that one was ever checked. That
     * is precisely what the nothing-to-probe branch above is written to protect, and an app that
     * happens to publish a safe action walks straight past it. The screen does not offer the button
     * for a consent app, but a route takes POSTs and not only button presses, so the refusal
     * belongs where {@link connectBrokeredWithFields} puts its own: on the SCHEME RECORDED ON THE
     * APP'S ROW, asked through {@link isFieldScheme} so the schemes this admits cannot drift from
     * the schemes that have a key to admit.

     * deployment that says which app this person connected: the app is read off
     * `composio_connections`, and a revoke needs it. Delete first and a revoke that then fails
     * leaves a live grant on somebody's mailbox that no operation here can reach, because the one
     * value it would have to be revoked under is gone. The other order costs nothing by
     * comparison — a revoke that throws leaves the row standing, the person presses disconnect
     * again, and the second attempt has everything the first one had.
     *
     * WHICH ALSO MEANS THE FAILURE IS LOUD. Nothing is caught here: a broker that will not answer
     * ends this call, and no row and no trail entry claims an account was disconnected when the
     * account is still live.
     *
     * `vendorRevocationRequested` IS WHAT WAS ASKED FOR, NOT THAT A CALL WAS MADE — {@link
     * ComposioBroker.revoke}'s own answer, passed through. True where an account was found and its
     * withdrawal asked for, false where there was none to withdraw, and the value of the field is
     * exactly that a reader can tell an account this deployment acted on from one that outlives it
     * somewhere else.
     *
     * IT SAYS "REQUESTED" BECAUSE THE VENDOR'S ANSWER SUPPORTS NOTHING STRONGER, and the field was
     * renamed from `vendorRevoked` when that turned out to be false in the plainest way: the
     * adapter behind it was soft-deleting the account and asking for no upstream revocation at all,
     * so every row saying a grant had been withdrawn described one still live at Google. The ask is
     * now made; what a broker can promise synchronously is that the account is gone at Composio and
     * that the provider has been asked, because the withdrawal itself runs as a background job with
     * no supported way to poll it.
     *
     * EXCEPT WHERE THE APP IS ONE SOMEBODY TYPED A KEY INTO, AND THERE IT IS FALSE BY CONSTRUCTION
     * RATHER THAN BY WHAT THE VENDOR FOUND. `revoke_on_delete` asks the PROVIDER to end a grant,
     * which is a real request for a consent account — Google or Slack acts on it — and a
     * meaningless one for an API key. There is no grant behind a key to withdraw: the value is
     * still valid at the app and still works for anyone holding it, so the account ends at Composio
     * and nothing was asked of anybody else. Saying otherwise would be the one row in this trail
     * nobody could rely on, which is the failure the paragraph above describes arriving a second
     * time by a different road — a withdrawal recorded for something that was never granted. So the
     * scheme recorded on the app's row decides this field for a field connection, and the broker's
     * own answer decides it for every other.
     *
     * THE SCHEME IS THE ONE ON THE APP'S ROW, for {@link connectBrokeredWithFields}' reason: it is
     * what this deployment's authorization config was created AS and what the account was attached
     * to, and a fresh read of the catalogue is a second answer — a key connection described as
     * consent because the vendor has since started publishing managed OAuth for the app. The
     * person's half of this fact is already written on the disconnect row they are shown: their key
     * still works at the app, and rotating it there is what ends it. This is the trail's half of
     * the same sentence.
     *
     * THE VENDOR IS ASKED WHETHER OR NOT A ROW IS HERE. The row is a cache of Composio's answer
     * and never the account itself (see {@link brokeredConnection}), so its absence is not
     * evidence that the grant is gone: the confirm above deletes it on any `false` from the
     * vendor, and a person whose row was cleared that way can still be holding a live account at
     * Composio with nothing left here pointing at it. Asking anyway is the only operation in this
     * deployment that can end such a grant, and it costs nothing where there is genuinely nothing
     * to withdraw — the broker answers `false` and says so. Skipping the revoke for want of a
     * local row would make the safe half of disconnect unreachable for exactly the person who
     * needs it, on the strength of a cache we already know drifts.
     *
     * BUT THE TRAIL RECORDS ONLY A DISCONNECT THAT HAPPENED. The event is filed where something
     * actually ended — a row deleted here, or a grant withdrawn at the vendor — and not otherwise.
     * A call that found no row and withdrew no grant disconnected nothing, and an
     * `mcp.account_disconnected` row for it tells whoever reads the trail that somebody's account
     * ended at a moment when nobody's did. It is the criterion
     * {@link confirmBrokeredConnection} files its own event under, one act the other way round:
     * the trail records acts, and a call that changed nothing performed none.
     *
     * WHICH IS NOT THE SAME QUESTION AS `vendorRevocationRequested`. A row here with no grant at
     * the vendor is a disconnect — the gate this deployment decides every brokered call on was
     * open, and this call closed it — so the event is filed, saying
     * `vendorRevocationRequested: false`. A grant at the vendor
     * with no row here is a disconnect too, and the weightier of the two, because somebody's live
     * account was ended; the event is filed for that as well. Only where both are absent is there
     * no act to record, and the two cases stay legible in the trail because the field still says
     * which of them happened.
     *
     * SO THE FILING IS DECIDED ON THE BROKER'S OWN ANSWER AND NOT ON THE FIELD, because for a field
     * connection the two part company on purpose. A key account the vendor found and ended with no
     * row here is an act — somebody's live connection stopped existing — and gating the event on a
     * value that is false by construction would leave exactly that act unrecorded. The field
     * answers what was asked of the provider; `ended` answers whether anything was there.

     * this deployment's vault. They could not exercise it — the actor comes from a session they no
     * longer get — but the deployment still held a usable secret for a person who had been removed,
     * which is not what an administrator was told they did, and is the first thing a customer asks
     * about a per-person connector.
     *
     * LOOKED UP IN THE VAULT, NOT THROUGH THE JOIN TABLE. `mcp_user_credentials.user_id` cascades on
     * a user row being deleted, so by the time somebody is gone the join row can be gone too and the
     * credential is orphaned: unrevoked, referenced by nothing, reachable from no screen and by no
     * code path. `credentials.key_id` holds the user id for an `mcp_user_token`, so the vault can
     * still be asked directly — which makes this work for the person who was removed and for the one
     * whose row was deleted underneath it.
     *
     * The join rows go too, so the account pages stop claiming a connection this deployment can no
     * longer use.
     *
     * AND THE BROKERED CONNECTIONS, which are neither a credential nor a join row. Composio holds
     * the account, so there is no secret in the vault to find and the `composio_connections` row is
     * itself the permission — the only thing deciding whether a call may go out as this person.
     * Sweeping the vault alone therefore left that gate passing for somebody who had been removed.
     *
     * NOT VENDOR-SIDE REVOCATION FOR THE VAULT HALF. That needs the OAuth client and the vendor's
     * revoke endpoint, and it belongs with disconnect. Those rows are the half that stops us
     * holding the secret; the grant at Google outlives it until somebody revokes it there. Said
     * plainly rather than implied, because the difference matters to whoever has to answer for it.
     *
     * THE BROKERED HALF DOES END IT AT THE VENDOR, because there is no secret of ours to stop
     * holding: clearing the row alone would shut the gate this deployment owns and leave the
     * mailbox attached at Composio, which is "we removed their access" being untrue of the only
     * thing that matters, for the person it matters most about. So every app this person connected
     * is revoked through the broker, exactly as {@link disconnectBrokered} revokes for one and
     * {@link removeServer} for a whole app.
     *
     * REVOKE BEFORE DELETE, ALWAYS. The row is the only thing that names which apps this person
     * had, and it outlives the `users` row precisely so offboarding can still find them — which
     * was the table's whole justification and until now was theoretical. A delete that ran first
     * would leave a failed revoke with nothing to revoke under: a live grant on a departed
     * person's mailbox that no operation in this deployment can reach. The other order costs a
     * repeat of an act nobody minds repeating. Nothing is caught around the revokes either, so a
     * broker that will not answer ends this method with the rows still standing rather than
     * letting it report an ending that did not happen.
