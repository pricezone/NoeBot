 * The connect flow: sending a person to a vendor to consent, and believing what comes back.
 *
 * The browser is in the middle of this, which is the whole difficulty. An authorization code arrives
 * on a request that somebody else's server sent the person to, so nothing on it can be believed on
 * its own — not who is connecting, not which server they meant, not that they ever asked. Two things
 * carry the truth across: a sealed state, which is this deployment's own statement about the request
 * it started, and a PKCE verifier, which proves the code being redeemed belongs to that request.
 *
 * SEALED, not signed, and that distinction is the reason this comment exists. The state carries the
 * PKCE verifier, and the callback URL carries the verifier's state and the authorization code
 * TOGETHER. A dynamically registered client is public — it proves itself with PKCE and no secret —
 * so the verifier is the only thing binding that code to this deployment. A signed state is readable
 * by anybody holding it, and a callback URL is held by every CDN log, proxy log, browser history and
 * vendor log it passes through: any one of those readers could redeem the code. Encrypted, the state
 * says nothing to anybody but this deployment.
 *
 * Everything here fails closed. A state that was tampered with, replayed after it expired, or minted
 * for some other purpose reads back as nothing, because the alternative is attaching one person's
 * Google account to another person's row.
