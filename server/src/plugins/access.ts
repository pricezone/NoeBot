/**
 * How one server row is reached: which protocol, whose credential, which app at a broker, and whose
 * name the trail records.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS AS ONE THING. These three questions were asked separately, in three places, each
 * deriving its own answer from whichever field was nearest. That was complete while every server
 * either had a frozen catalogue entry or was somebody's MCP endpoint. A Composio app is neither: it
 * is a row an operator enabled, with no entry to carry a transport field and no OAuth kind to read,
 * so all three questions answered wrongly by default and each failed silently in its own direction.
 *
 * The fourth question arrived the same way. Which app a brokered row is was read from the row id by
 * the gate that checks whether a person has connected it, from the url by the transport that dials
 * it, and described as a third thing by the schema column that records the connection — with nothing
 * comparing the three, so a row whose id and url slug differed was checked against one app and run
 * against another.
 *
 * Resolved once, here, and read as a field everywhere else. A fourth kind of server cannot be added
 * without filling in this function, and the test beside it enumerates every row shape that exists —
 * which is the exhaustiveness the previous arrangement could not offer, since nothing connects three
 * independent string comparisons.
