/**
 * What a member may use, decided from the switches an administrator set.
 *
 * Pure: no database, no clock. `settings-store.ts` reads the rows, `controls.ts` holds a snapshot
 * for the synchronous policy check, and both ask this module for the answer so the two can never
 * disagree about what a row means.
 *
 * THE RULE, taken from the two products this closes the gap on:
 *
 * - The organization row is the baseline (OpenAI: "Workspace default > Workspace capabilities").
 * - A role row replaces the baseline for everybody holding that role (OpenAI custom roles).
 * - A group row can only widen (Grok Bot: "Group settings only widen: a group can grant its members
 *   more than the team allows, never less"). `true` grants; `false` is recorded and changes nothing.
 * - No row anywhere means the built-in default below, which keeps every deployment that has never
 *   opened this screen working exactly as it did.
