/**
 * One headless turn, run into the Intelligence thread the person will open.
 *
 * WRITTEN AGAINST `@copilotkit/runtime` 1.69.0, MIRRORING
 * `node_modules/@copilotkit/runtime/dist/v2/runtime/core/channel-manager.mjs:189-316`
 * (`runCanonicalChannelAgent`, the package's own module-private headless-turn engine) and
 * `dist/v2/runtime/handlers/intelligence/run.mjs:114-127` for `persistedInputMessages`. That engine is
 * not exported, so this is a hand copy of it with one addition — `getOrCreateThread` first — and it
 * has to be re-read against the package whenever the runtime is upgraded.
 *
 * WHY NOT A SECOND MOUNTED HANDLER. A loopback that mounts a second `mountCopilotRuntime` and POSTs
 * to its own run route is viable on identity grounds: `identifyUser` and `identifyActor` are both
 * injectable there (`copilot.ts:915-916`), so a routine's request could assert its owner without a
 * header. It was rejected on information, not on identity. The run route answers at gateway-JOIN
 * rather than at completion (`run.mjs:229-247` returns `{threadId, runId, joinToken, realtime}` as
 * soon as the runner has joined), so a caller learns that a turn STARTED and nothing else: no
 * completion signal, no reply text, and no failure. Recovering either would need a second transport —
 * a websocket back into the gateway — which is strictly more moving parts for strictly less
 * information than driving the runner in-process.
 *
 * WHAT WE ARE REACHING INTO. Five `ɵ`-prefixed methods: `ɵgetRunnerWsUrl` and `ɵgetRunnerAuthToken`
 * (at wiring time, in `index.ts`), and `ɵacquireThreadLock`, `ɵrenewThreadLock`,
 * `ɵcleanupThreadLock` here. They typecheck today and are how the package's own handlers do this, but
 * the `ɵ` prefix is the package saying it may change them without a major. Their request and response
 * interfaces — `AcquireThreadLockRequest`, `RenewThreadLockRequest`, `CleanupThreadLockRequest` — are
 * declared in `dist/v2/runtime/intelligence-platform/client.d.mts:339-367` and are NOT exported from
 * `@copilotkit/runtime/v2`, so the shapes in `IntelligenceLike` below are RESTATED BY HAND. Nothing
 * fails loudly when the package changes them: a renamed field would typecheck against our own
 * restatement and be silently dropped on the wire. That is what the test file is for.
 *
 * THE LOCK LIFECYCLE IS NOW OURS TO KEEP CORRECT. In the browser path the runtime holds the lock and
 * releases it; here we do. A bug in it is not a failed routine, it is a thread the person cannot chat
 * in — see the `finally` block, which is the single most important thing in this file.
 *
 * GATEWAY AVAILABILITY IS NOW ON THE CRON RUN'S CRITICAL PATH. Driving the runner means the turn goes
 * through the Intelligence gateway's Phoenix channel: it can answer `CHANNEL_JOIN_ERROR` or time out
 * joining (`runner/intelligence.mjs:194-229`), and events must be durably acknowledged within
 * `EVENT_DURABILITY_DEADLINE_MS = 60_000` (`intelligence.mjs:16, 505-511`) or the run fails. So a
 * routine firing during an Intelligence incident fails HERE, where a turn that only called the model
 * and never persisted anything would have succeeded. That trade was made deliberately: a reply nobody
 * can find in the channel is not a reply, and the transcript is the whole point of a routine.
 *
 * WHY A SECOND RUNNER INSTANCE IS SAFE. The thread lock is a platform resource, not a process one —
 * `POST /api/threads/:id/lock`, Redis-backed, keyed by thread — so a lock taken by this runner is seen
 * by the runtime's runner and by every other replica. `IntelligenceAgentRunner.threads` is a local
 * fast path (`intelligence.mjs:105`, "Thread already running") and nothing else, which is why the
 * runner is built ONCE at wiring time and reused: one instance per turn would fragment that map, and
 * two concurrent turns on one thread would then race past the local check and collide at the platform
 * lock instead of failing cheaply here.
