     *
     * AND THE SAME NOW HOLDS OF EVERY CONSENT ROW AND NOT ONLY THE BACKFILLED ONES, because the
     * writer that records a connection sets `verified` itself: `recordBrokeredConnection` is the
     * one place a row is written, and `confirmBrokeredConnection` calls it with `verified: true` on
     * the vendor's yes. So a consent connection made today carries the same true migration 0038
     * wrote and earns it the same way — the vendor answered that the account is attached — and its
     * `verified_at` is the moment of that answer: the consent itself on the first confirm, and the
     * vendor's yes again on every later one, because a confirm really does go and ask. What it used
     * to do was insert on the defaults, and until it stopped, every consent connection made since
     * the backfill read `false` beside a null `verified_at` — the very pair a key connection nobody
     * has ever checked reads — so nothing could tell the two apart, and the rows the migration
     * touched were the only ones in the table saying anything true.
     *
     * ON A CONSENT ROW, AND ONLY THERE. That confirm runs from an effect on mount, so what it
     * writes it writes on every page load — and the vendor's yes is evidence about a KEY of
     * nothing, because Composio takes a key when it is typed and never tests it again. So the
     * confirm branches on the scheme recorded on the app's row: it writes this flag where consent
     * IS the check, and leaves a key connection's recorded verdict exactly as the last real call
     * left it. Written across a key row instead, it restated the consent pair below — `verified`
     * true beside a null `probe_action` — over the record of a check that had actually happened,
     * and moved this timestamp to the page load, so the page's own sentence named a day on which
     * nothing was checked.
     *
     * AND A CHECK THAT COULD NOT BE MADE LEAVES THIS COLUMN ALONE, which is the one thing a writer
     * of it must not improvise. `false` here means "no evidence that this connection answers", and

     * to exist whatever happens, the outage is written as the unchecked pair, and on a re-check,
     * which finds a row already standing, NOTHING IS WRITTEN AT ALL. Clearing a verification
     * because the vendor could not be reached destroys the only record anywhere that this
     * connection was ever checked, and the date beside it, on the word of an event that says
     * nothing about the key. See {@link composioConnections.probeAction}.
     *
     * WHAT THE PAIR SEPARATES IS A CHECKED CONNECTION FROM AN UNCHECKED ONE, and never one KIND of
     * connection from another. Which kind a row is comes from the app's own `auth_scheme`, which

     *                          in neither case about the key.
     *
     *                          THE OUTAGE WAS NOT ALWAYS HERE, and where it used to land is the
     *                          reason this clause is spelled out. `callTool` answers with a result

     *                          the probe read that as the vendor's verdict: an outage was written
     *                          down as the FOURTH state below — the accusation — while the connect
     *                          path deleted the account somebody had just made and told them their
     *                          key was refused. An unreachable vendor is not a fifth state and has
     *                          no column of its own, because the row records what is KNOWN about a
     *                          connection and an outage establishes nothing: the honest record is
     *                          the mildest pair, and the trail carries the attempt. See
     *                          {@link BrokeredProbe} in `plugins/store.ts` for the four answers a
     *                          check can reach and which of them may be written here.
     *   null, verified       — a CONSENT connection. The vendor's own yes at the end of its own
     *                          screen is the evidence, and no call was ever made against the
     *                          account, so there is no action to name and there never will be.
     *                          Which is why `confirmBrokeredConnection`, the one writer of this
     *                          pair, writes it only for a consent app: on a key row it is not a
     *                          heal but one of the other three states overwritten by a page load.
     *   a name, verified     — it ran in this person's account and the vendor took the key.

     *                          still standing. A live account with a bad key behind it.
     *
     *                          AND ONLY A CALL THE VENDOR ANSWERED MAY WRITE IT. This pair is an
     *                          accusation — the settings page draws it as "your key was checked and
     *                          rejected, disconnect it" — so the name is withheld from every
     *                          outcome that cannot be shown to have run in the account. That is
     *                          structural rather than a rule anybody has to remember:

     *                          outcome, so the writer has none to record.
     *
     * AND NULL ON A ROW WRITTEN BEFORE THIS COLUMN EXISTED, which is the same null and deliberately
     * so. No backfill is possible or wanted: what a check spent in March is not recoverable, and
     * today's chooser answering for it is exactly the inference this column retires. The rows
     * migration 0038 touched are consent rows, where null is permanently right; a key row that
     * predates it reads as unchecked, the mildest of the four states and the only safe direction to
     * be uncertain in — a name invented for it would be the false accusation above, written down.
     *

/**
 * The tools a skill says it needs. A row is a declaration, and a declaration is not a grant.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Choosing between a thousand tools is a retrieval problem, and the unit being
 * retrieved has to be the skill rather than the tool: a model picks the skill from its summary, and
 * the skill says which tools to load. Without this table there is no such unit. See K3.
 *
 * IT GRANTS NOTHING, AND THAT IS LOAD-BEARING RATHER THAN TIDY. Anybody signed in may write a skill,
 * precisely because a skill adds no capability — `plugins/routes.ts` says so where it declines to
 * require an administrator. If naming a tool here could make it callable, then writing a skill would
 * be a way to grant yourself a tool, and the one surface in this deployment that is deliberately not
 * an administrator's would become the way around every surface that is. What a Bot may call stays
 * `plugin_grants`; this only ever narrows what is offered out of what was already granted.
 *
 * NO FOREIGN KEY TO `mcp_tools`, on purpose. Refreshing a server deletes every one of its tool rows
 * and writes them again (`plugins/store.ts`), so a composite key with `on delete cascade` would empty
 * every skill's declarations on a routine refresh. `plugin_grants.ref` is plain text for the same
 * reason, and holding the two in the same shape is what lets them be compared without either side
 * parsing the other's format. The cost is a ref that can outlive the tool it names, which is the
 * price grants already pay, and is why a missing tool must read as "load nothing" rather than as an
 * error at run time.
