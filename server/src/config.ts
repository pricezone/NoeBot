 * The port the API listens on, from either of its two names.
 *
 * `PORT` and `SERVER_PORT` name one number: either moves the server, and two that disagree are
 * refused at boot rather than half-applied. Read through `optional` like every other setting here,
 * and that is the point. An unset variable declared in a compose file, or left as `PORT=` in a
 * `.env`, arrives as an empty string rather than as absent, so `process.env.PORT ??
 * process.env.SERVER_PORT` never fell through to the second name, and `Number.parseInt("")` is
 * `NaN`. Given `NaN`, `Bun.serve` binds an ephemeral port: the server came up somewhere nobody had
 * asked for, `SERVER_PORT` ignored, and the script polling it reported a server that never
 * started — the failure #312 set out to remove, back through the other name.
 *
 * A value that is not a whole port number is refused for the reason the caps above are: `30o1`
 * used to start the server on port 30, and a typo has to fail where somebody is looking.
