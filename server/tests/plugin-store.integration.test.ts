 * The fixtures in this file cannot do that: they INSERT at `gmail`, `notion`, `bot_helper` and
 * `user_asker`, and those ids are not a choice. `gmail` is the toolkit slug that gets sent to
 * Composio. `notion` is fixed twice over: the dynamic-registration suite pins `dynamicServerId` to
 * it because that is the catalogue entry which registers its own client, and the test for an action
 * listed before the effect columns existed inserts a `notion` server row directly, because a
 * first-party row is what it is about. A fixture that inserts at an id cannot coexist with a real
 * row at that id: skipping the delete would only turn the collision into a primary-key conflict,
 * and capture-and-restore would be a lot of machinery whose failure mode is destroying the thing
 * it protects, because the cascade has already run by the time it restores.
 *
 * What the cascade takes is why this is a refusal rather than a warning. `mcp_user_credentials`
 * references `mcp_servers.id`, so removing a real `notion` row takes every person's per-user
 * credential row with it and leaves their encrypted vault rows referenced by nothing — unreachable
 * from any screen and invisible to `retireConnectionsFor`, which exists to stop exactly that state.
 * Removing a real Bot takes six tables: its channel memberships, its agent profile, everyone's
 * preferences for it, its routines and all of their run history, its component exclusions and its
 * plugin grants. Removing a real PERSON takes ten: their sign-in accounts and live sessions, their
 * roles, their channel memberships and intelligence mappings, their per-Bot preferences and written
 * instructions, their skills, their routines, and every per-user connector credential they hold —
 * and nulls the owner off their agent profiles and SSO provider besides. The fixtures then re-insert
 * byte-identical look-alikes, so nothing on screen would say it happened.
 *
 * The list below is every table this file deletes from at an id it did not invent — an id spelled
 * the way production spells it, so a row already sitting at it belongs to somebody else. Each of
 * `mcp_servers`, `agents`, `composio_connections` and `users` is asked about here, and nothing else
 * needs to be: `mcp_tools` and `plugin_grants` are the two remaining unconditional deletes and both
 * are reached only by a key that references one of these four — `mcp_tools.server_id` names a
 * server, `plugin_grants.agent_id` names a Bot — so a row at either could not exist without the
 * guard having already refused over its parent. Every other delete in this file names an id
 * carrying {@link suite}, and the reads that touch the deployment's own `google-drive` row skip
 * their delete instead, on the {@link suiteCreatedServerRow} flags above.
 *
 * So the deletes in {@link freshDatabase} are authorised by {@link ownsFixtureIds} and this is what

   * `readOnlyHint` is recorded as NOTHING AT ALL — not as `read`, not as a value overridden further
   * down — whether or not the reviewed write list already covers the name.
   *
   * REASON. The SDK warns where it declares these hints that a client must not make tool-use
   * decisions from annotations an untrusted server supplied, and the two hints are not symmetrical
   * against that warning. `destructiveHint` can only move an action from read to write, so a server
   * that lies with it restricts itself. `readOnlyHint` moves an action the other way, and it would
   * buy nothing in the two curated cases — a name on `writeTools` never reaches the column, and a
   * name absent from it already reads as a read — while opening the third: a server an
   * administrator added by URL has no reviewed list, and `classifyTool` returns on the recorded
   * column BEFORE its `if (!entry) return "write"`, so believing the hint would let an arbitrary
   * server declare its whole surface harmless and turn "no reviewed list means everything is a
   * write" into an opt-out.
   *
   * WHY NULL IS THE ASSERTION rather than a classification. Both `readOnlyHint` fixtures come out
   * of `listServers` correctly whatever the column holds — one is on the write list, the other is
   * not — so a classification assertion alone would pass with the hint written down and overruled
   * downstream. NULL in the column is what says it was never read.

 * decides what config is created at the vendor: an enable path that re-derived it here rather than
 * passing the caller's through would be a second answer to the question this argument exists to
 * settle once.
 *
 * `composio-linear` is cleaned up in a `finally` rather than by {@link freshDatabase}, which knows
 * only the ids the guard at the top of this file cleared. The row is checked absent before the add

 * Removing an app ends every account at the vendor, and only then forgets where they were.

 * while their rows are still standing, deletes the rows after that, and drops the deployment's
 * auth config last of all — and the trail says of each person that the grant was really withdrawn.
 *
 * REASON. Clearing `composio_connections` closes the gate this deployment owns and nothing else:
 * the account the person attached is still live at Composio, and an administrator who pressed
 * "remove" was not told they had left it there. So the removal ends the accounts too, and the
 * order is forced. A brokered row's toolkit is readable off nothing but the row, so delete-first
 * and a revoke that then fails leaves a live grant on somebody's mailbox with no value left here
 * to revoke it under; revoke-first and the same failure leaves the app present, every account
 * dead, and removing again finishes the job. Dead-and-reachable beats live-and-unreachable.
 *
 * THE AUTH CONFIG GOES LAST for the same reasoning one step out. An orphaned auth config grants
 * nobody anything — it is a shape this deployment holds at Composio, not an account — while a live
 * account whose config has already gone is access nobody here can end.
 *
 * ASSERTED ON WHAT EACH CALL SAW, not on a count. Counting says nothing about order, and the order
 * is the entire property: an implementation that deleted the rows first and revoked off what the
 * delete returned would make exactly the same calls in exactly the same sequence.
 *

/**
 * A database fault on the vault read, which is not a withdrawn credential.

 * the call is refused as a fault of ours — it is on the {@link isDeploymentFault} shelf, and it is
 * NOT a {@link PluginRefusedError}. Neither the sentence the caller gets nor the row the trail keeps
 * says a credential was withdrawn.
 *
 * REASON. `secretFor` used to tell a withdrawn credential from a broken query by looking for the
 * words "revoked" and "not found" inside `error.message`. drizzle reports every failure as a
 * `DrizzleQueryError` whose message opens `Failed query: select "encrypted_value", "revoked_at" from
 * "credentials" …` — so the column name matched the substring, and EVERY database fault on that read
 * became the one sentence that is certainly false about it: a Postgres that is down, an address that
 * names no database, a statement the server cancelled, each reported as an administrator having
 * taken the credential away.
 *
 * WHY THAT IS WORSE THAN A WRONG MESSAGE. The confident sentence is a {@link PluginRefusedError},
 * which is the one class this codebase relays VERBATIM. It reaches the model as the reason the tool
 * failed, a browser through the routes that pass a refusal straight out as a 400, and
 * `mcp_servers.last_error` for whoever operates the deployment — and the step it names, add the
 * credential again, is work against a credential that was never the problem while the real fault
 * goes unreported. Told apart by class, all three audiences get "that did not work" instead, which
 * is what a fault of ours is allowed to say.
 *
 * THE FAULT IS A REAL ONE, which is the point of the fixture. The production credential store
 * issues its production statement over an address that resolves to no database, so what arrives at
 * `secretFor` is drizzle's own wrapper around the driver's complaint. A hand-thrown `Error` would
 * prove nothing here: the message is exactly what the bug was reading, so the message has to come
