/**
 * What an MCP listing carries out of the transport, and what the classifier then makes of it.
 *
 * WHY THIS SUITE EXISTS. The MCP specification lets a server publish `annotations.destructiveHint`,
 * and `listTools` used to drop the whole `annotations` object on the floor. Nothing failed: every
 * MCP-listed tool simply arrived with no effect, `refreshTools` recorded null, and `classifyTool`
 * fell through to the reviewed write list. That looked correct — and it was, for every name a
 * person had already reviewed. For a name the reviewed list did not happen to hold, a tool the
 * vendor had explicitly declared destructive classified as a READ. Fail-open on a
 * permission-adjacent decision, and invisible, because the only evidence was a field never read.
 *
 * These cases pin the transport and the classifier TOGETHER rather than separately. A unit test of
 * `listTools` alone would prove a field is copied; a unit test of `classifyTool` alone would prove
 * a string is honoured. Neither would have caught this, because the defect lived exactly in the
 * join: the transport never produced the string the classifier was already willing to act on. So
 * each case here goes over a real MCP connection and then through the same call `store.ts` makes,
 * `classifyTool(entry, name, true, tool.effect ?? null)` — what `refreshTools` writes to the column
 * and what the call path reads back out of it.

 * Widening the type here rather than casting keeps the fixture honest: `ToolAnnotations` is the
 * SDK's own declaration, so a hint renamed upstream fails this file at compile time instead of
