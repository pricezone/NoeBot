 * on a URL somebody else's server sent the person to, so nothing on that request can be believed on
 * its own: not who is connecting, not which server they meant, and not that they ever asked. The
 * sealed state is what carries those facts across, and the PKCE verifier is what proves the code
 * being redeemed belongs to the request that started it.
 *
 * So these tests are almost entirely about refusal. A state that was tampered with, replayed after
 * expiry, or minted for another purpose has to come back as nothing, because the alternative is
 * attaching somebody else's Google account to this person's row.
