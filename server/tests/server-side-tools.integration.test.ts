/**
 * A tool call that happens with no browser involved.

 * The loop used to run in the surface, so every one of these paths needed somebody watching. What is
 * asserted here is that the same call runs from the server and arrives at a real MCP server, and
 * that moving it did not take the grant, the policy or the audit row with it.
 *
 * The server on the other end is `@copilotkit/aimock`, ours, speaking real MCP over HTTP rather than
 * a stubbed fetch. A stub would pass whether or not we had understood the protocol; this fails if
 * the wire format moves underneath us, which is the whole promise of pointing a Bot at somebody
