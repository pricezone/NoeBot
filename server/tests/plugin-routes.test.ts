 * the object: a stub whose `brokeredConnectionsFor` answered three fields where the real one
 * answers seven typechecked in silence, and every assertion above it then passed whether or not the
 * route carried the other four. `Partial<PluginStore>` is the same widening with the signatures
 * kept, so a stub that answers a shape the real store cannot is a compile error here rather than a
 * green test.
 *
 * AND THE FILLERS BELOW HAD TO GO WITH IT, which is the half that looks unrelated and is not.
 * `createApp` takes thirty positional stores, and the spread that skipped to the fifteenth was
 * an array of unknown LENGTH — so TypeScript had no idea which parameter the store landed on and
 * checked it against the next one in the signature. Typing the store without fixing that only moves
 * the silence: see {@link UP_TO_PLUGIN_STORE}.

   * capability handed out about an app whose connection kind is unknown, and the three readers of
   * this same column in `plugins/store.ts` all fail closed on that value: the re-check refuses, the
   * disconnect claims no revocation, and the mount-time confirm writes nothing. A route that failed
   * open was the last one that did, and a person told to ask an administrator gets a sentence naming
   * the act that fixes it — which is more than the consent arm's dead end offered them.
