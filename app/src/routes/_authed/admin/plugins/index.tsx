 * do — meant visiting two of them, and the third was a different kind of thing altogether. Two
 * lists say the same thing in one read: what is connected, and what else there is.
 *
 * Every row goes to that vendor's own page, because what a connector needs configured is not the
 * same from one vendor to the next. A token, an OAuth client, an instance hostname, and a grant per
 * tool per Bot do not fit on a row, and the previous screen's attempt to fit them made a page that
