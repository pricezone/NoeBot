 * The sibling screen — `$key_.tools.$tool` — answers the same question from the other end, one
 * action and every Bot, and that is the right shape when somebody is thinking about an action. It
 * is the wrong shape for setting a Bot up against an app that offers a hundred and sixty-seven of
 * them: that is one visit per action, and the decision being made ("what can this Bot do in Slack")
 * is never on screen at once.
 *
 * So the list is searchable and split by what a boundary sees. A read and a write are not the same
 * decision, and an app's actions arrive interleaved by name, which puts `delete_channel` two rows
 * under `list_channels` with nothing between them but a word.
 *
 * `$key_` opts this route out of nesting under `$key.tsx`, so the connector page stays a page rather
 * than becoming a layout with an outlet.
