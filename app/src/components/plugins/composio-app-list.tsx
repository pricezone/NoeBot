   * own sentence about a bad key, the banner never showed it, because `enable.error` was Gmail's
   * and Gmail's was null. What was left was a row saying "Add" and no record that anything failed.
   *
   * THE MUTATION-LEVEL `onError` STILL FIRES AFTER `removeObserver`, which is why this works and
