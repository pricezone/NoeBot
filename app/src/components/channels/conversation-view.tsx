   * reference at all: a drained turn whose send failed used to release everything it was carrying.
   * That one is now a restore — the messages go back in the queue, still holding their rows — so
   * the ways out are the two in `apply` above, a removal and the cap's excess, and this.
   *
   * The other two go through `apply` above. This one goes through React:
   * `queue.ts` is candid that the queue "lives and dies with the component holding it" and that
   * switching channels "takes anything parked in it with it" — but that paragraph is about the
   * person's WORDS, which they watched land on screen and can retype. It was never a statement
   * about the staged rows underneath them, and `releaseStagedAttachment` is explicit that a parked
   * entry holds the only reference anything has to those.
   *
   * WHAT IT COSTS TO SKIP, stated because it is smaller than the other two and the fix should be
   * priced honestly: the upload cap is scoped by `uploadGroup`, minted per composer mount, so this
   * orphan does not refuse anybody's next pick the way a removal's would — the composer that staged
   * it is gone and its group with it. It is storage held for up to a day by
   * `cull-staged-attachments.ts`, not a 409. Worth releasing anyway, because the row is bytes in a
   * table nobody will ever ask for again and the release is two lines.
   *
   * BEST-EFFORT IN THE STRICTEST SENSE. This runs during teardown, so the requests go out into a
   * component that is already gone and nothing here could act on an answer even in principle —
   * which is exactly what `releaseStagedAttachment` already is. A tab CLOSING is not this path at
   * all and is not chased: the page is going, `fetch` on the way out is not reliable, and the
   * sweeper is the honest answer for that one.
   *
   * The ref rather than the state, for the reason `apply` records: on an unmount that follows a
   * transition in the same commit, the state is a render behind and the ref is not. Empty on
   * StrictMode's development double-mount, which makes that pass a no-op.

           * THE HALF OF THE PER-MESSAGE CAP THE COMPOSER CANNOT SEE.
           *
           * The composer counts what is on its own strip, and parking a message empties it. The
           * server counts every row this person has staged in that composer's `uploadGroup` that
           * has not been sent, and parking a message changes nothing about those: `attachedAt` is
           * written when the message really goes. So without this the two disagree by exactly the
           * size of the queue, and a ninth pick behind eight parked files is accepted here and
           * refused on arrival — a 409 the person was given no chance to avoid, phrased as a count
           * against a strip they can see is empty.
           *
           * READ OFF THE QUEUE ON EVERY RENDER RATHER THAN ACCUMULATED, which is what makes it fall
           * as well as rise. A running total would be right until somebody took a parked message
           * back, and then it would hold slots that nothing occupies — the same refusal, now issued
           * by their own client with no round trip to blame it on.
           *
           * `queued` and not `queuedRef`: this is a render, so the state is the value React is
           * drawing from, and the ref exists for the callbacks that cannot wait a render. They
           * agree here anyway — `apply` writes both on the same line.

/**
 * GIVE BACK THE STAGED ROW BEHIND AN ATTACHMENT THE QUEUE HAS LET GO OF.
 *
 * The composer hands its staged attachments to the queue as a message is parked and clears its own
 * strip in the same breath, so a parked entry holds the only reference anything has to those rows.
 * When `reduceQueue` reports one in `droppedAttachments` — a message taken back before it ran, or
 * the excess the cap re-check bumped off a drained turn — this is the last chance to release it.
 *
 * WHAT NOT DOING THIS COSTS. The row stays with `attachedAt IS NULL` until `cull-staged-
 * attachments.ts` sweeps it a day later. Until then the upload handler counts it against this
 * person's per-channel limit and refuses their ninth pick by naming files that are on nobody's
 * screen, with no way back to them. For the cap case that is the exact 409 the on-screen notice
 * exists to pre-empt, so leaving the row behind shipped the warning together with its cause.
 *
 * ONLY A ROW THAT EXISTS. `metadata.attachmentId` is written by `attachmentsConfigFor` from the
 * upload response, so an attachment that never finished uploading carries none and there is
 * nothing to delete — the same test `composer.tsx` applies before its own DELETE.
 *
 * BEST-EFFORT, AND DELIBERATELY UNINSPECTED, for the reason `composer.tsx` records against the
 * same request: the person did not ask for this, so neither of the two answers it can fail with —
 * 404 for a non-uploader, 409 for an attachment already sent — is anything they could act on.
 *
 * THE SECOND CALLER OF THIS ENDPOINT, and deliberately not shared with the first. `composer.tsx`
 * owns the identical two lines for its own strip; a common helper is the right end state and is a
 * change to a file this one does not own, so the duplication is written down here rather than
 * reached across for.
