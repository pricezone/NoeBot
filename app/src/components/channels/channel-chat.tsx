 * modality with `classifyAttachment` on its own sniffed `mimeType` — but that correction lives on
 * the server and never comes back here. What this function writes IS the stored message, so a
 * `document` written here is what every later render of that message reads, for ever: a screenshot
 * whose part the browser mislabelled drew a grey file card over the picture, and the transcript's
 * document probe then paid a whole-file read per render for the privilege.
 *
 * Narrowed through the source union rather than read straight off, for the reason `parkedTiles` in
 * `chat-transcript.tsx` narrows the same field: a `data` source's `mimeType` is `file.type`, the
 * very claim being refused, and only a `url` source has been past the server. `attachmentModality`
 * falls back to the declared type when there is no corroborated one, so an attachment that somehow
 * arrives unuploaded is written exactly as it used to be.
 *
 * The comment this replaces said only "image" and "document" reach here because the composer's
 * upload config accepts no other kind of file. That reason is no longer true — the config's
 * `accept` is now the wildcard, and it is `screenPickedFiles` that holds the line. The conclusion still

   * before it — so Stop is not a failure here and nothing restores a draft somebody chose to end.

   * that touches the browser is several runs in a row: the Bot asks for a click, the run ENDS so
   * the browser can answer it, and another run starts carrying the answer. The agent reports itself
   * idle in every one of those gaps — the truth about the wire and a lie about the turn. OpenBot
   * registers every computer tool as a frontend tool, so the gaps open on ordinary work rather than
   * on some edge case, and anything keyed on the turn ending fires in the middle of one instead.
   *
   * Counters rather than booleans because nothing stops a second turn being started from a
   * component button while the first is still going, and two overlapping turns must not have the
   * first one to finish declare the conversation idle.
