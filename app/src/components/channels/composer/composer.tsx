   * not at all: a `ready` chip removed by hand, and a chip removed while its upload was still in
   * the air. Reconciling what was uploaded against what is drawn catches both without having to
   * know which happened.
   *
   * WHY IT CANNOT BE DONE AT THE MOMENT OF THE REMOVAL, WHICH IS THE OBVIOUS PLACE. `onUpload` is
   * handed a `File` and nothing else; the SDK mints the placeholder id itself and never says which
   * placeholder a given call belongs to. So at the moment somebody removes an uploading chip there
   * is no id to record, and when the upload lands there is no way to ask whether the chip it
   * belonged to is the one that went. Absence is the only signal that survives that, and it is a
   * complete one.
   *
   * WAITING FOR NOTHING TO BE UPLOADING IS THE WHOLE OF THE SAFETY. Between `onUpload` returning an
   * id and the SDK writing it onto its placeholder there is a window in which the row is known and
   * not yet drawn, and deleting there would destroy a live attachment. While that window is open
   * the placeholder is still `uploading` in committed state, so this gate closes exactly over it.
   * The gate is read off `attachments` rather than off the `staging` ref next to `stagedCount`
   * deliberately: a ref is not a render, so a ref-gated pass could skip the last commit and never
   * be woken again — a stale count self-corrects on the next commit, an un-deleted row does not.
   *

   * survive, and then calls `processFiles` directly. A pasted `text/plain;charset=utf-8` file —
   * which is what a browser reports for some clipboard entries — fails that comparison, and the
   * listener then returns having uploaded nothing, said nothing and called no `onUploadFailed`.
   * Silent. Paste also skipped the per-message cap and `MAX_FILE_BYTES`, which our screen enforces
   * and the SDK's does not.
   *
   * So this one listens in the CAPTURE phase, which runs before the hook's, and `stopPropagation`
   * on a paste we claim means the hook's listener never runs at all. What we claim goes through
   * `stageFiles`, the same path the `+` button and the drop already take, so screening, the cap and
   * the wording of a refusal are identical whichever way the file arrived.
   *
   * `shouldClaimPaste` decides whether the paste is ours: text wins whenever the clipboard carries
   * any, and a file is ours only when there is none. Copying a cell from a spreadsheet puts BOTH an
   * image and text on the clipboard, and claiming that paste attached a screenshot of the cell and
   * typed nothing.
   *
   * DECLINING IS NOT THE SAME AS THE TEXT BEING TYPED. What a declined paste does next is
   * PromptArea's rule, and it types the text only when the `text/html` is Microsoft Office markup.
   * So Word and Excel are handled; Google Sheets and Numbers are not — their image is attached
   * through `stagePastedImage` below and their text is lost. That is a known defect being kept for
   * now, and it is written out in full on `shouldClaimPaste` in `shared/attachments.ts`.

   * MORE FILES ON THIS STRIP THAN ONE MESSAGE MAY CARRY — a state the screening is supposed to make

   *
   * HOW THE STRIP GETS HERE. `sending` hides an outgoing message's attachments from `staged`, and
   * `stagedCount` resyncs off `staged`, so while a send is out the client-side count reads zero and
   * a second full batch is accepted behind the first. That is deliberate and right for a send that
   * lands: those files belong to the message that went, not to the one being built now. It is only
   * wrong when the send FAILS, because the `finally` then hands the first batch back — onto a strip
   * that has since filled up — and one draft is holding two messages' worth of files.
   *
   * WHY THE CAP AND NOT `canSendDraft`. That function asks about upload status and emptiness, which
   * are facts about each attachment; this is a fact about the draft as a whole, and it belongs
   * beside the other thing the composer knows and the draft model does not — see `stageFiles`,
   * which screens against the same number.
   *
   * NOTHING IS DROPPED TO RESOLVE IT, and that is the whole reason this is a gate rather than a
   * slice. Trimming the strip back to the cap would delete files somebody picked, on a path they
   * did not ask for, with the rows behind them released behind their back — which is verbatim the
   * failure every other release in this file exists to avoid. So every chip stays, every one is
   * removable by hand, and Send says no with a sentence naming the limit until it is.
