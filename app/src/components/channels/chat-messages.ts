/**
 * WHAT A FILE IS DRAWN AS, DECIDED FROM THE BYTES WHEN THE BYTES HAVE BEEN READ, AND FROM THE
 * BROWSER'S GUESS ONLY WHEN THEY HAVE NOT.
 *
 * A staged attachment's `type` is a guess made before the file was uploaded and never revisited.
 * Verified against the installed SDK rather than assumed: `useAttachments.processFiles` sets
 * `type: getModalityFromMimeType(file.type)` on the placeholder, and that function maps everything
 * that is not `image/`, `audio/` or `video/` to `"document"`; when `onUpload` answers, the merge is
 * `{ ...att, source, status: "ready", thumbnail, metadata }`, which replaces the SOURCE and never
 * the `type`. So the stale guess and the server's answer sit side by side on the same object.
 *
 * THE DISAGREEMENT IS ENGINEERED, NOT EXOTIC. `composer/picked-files.ts` deliberately passes a
 * claim that names no format — `application/octet-stream`, or `""` — so that the server is the one
 * that decides, from `sniffMimeType` over the actual bytes. A PNG dragged out of an editor is
 * therefore an attachment whose `type` says `document` and whose source says `image/png`.
 *
 * IT IS NOT ONLY THE WRONG PICTURE, AND THE LOUD HALF IS THE ONE THAT MATTERS. A text file claimed
 * as an image draws an `<img>` the browser cannot decode, `onError` fires, and the tile asserts in
 * the file's own name that it is unavailable — telling somebody a file was deleted while it sits
 * there intact. That is the reason this function exists.
 *
 * The other direction used to be argued here as a cost and no longer is. `SentAttachmentTile` does
 * send a HEAD probe for a document and none for an image, and this paragraph claimed the probe
 * "costs the server the whole file out of Postgres", so that a mislabelled screenshot bought "a
 * megabyte read on every render of the transcript". The attachment route has since grown a HEAD
 * branch that selects `sizeBytes` and never the bytes, so what a mislabelled screenshot buys is one
 * cheap metadata round trip nobody needed. Still waste, not worth a sentence in this size — kept
 * only to say that the sentence it replaces is wrong, since two review rounds read it as current.
 *
 * `classifyAttachment` RATHER THAN `mimeType.startsWith("image/")`, and this is the load-bearing
 * choice. It is the same function `server/src/channels/attachment-parts.ts` gates on, so a picture
 * is drawn to the person exactly when a picture was put in front of the Bot; the two sides cannot
 * drift because they ask one question. It also settles HEIC correctly — an image by media type that
 * no `<img>` here can render, whose honest tile is the card naming the file.
 *
 * THE FALLBACK IS THE DECLARED TYPE, NOT `"document"`. `mimeType` is optional on both schemas, so a
 * part without one is well-formed rather than malformed, and today that is EVERY sent message: see
 * the note at the `modality` field in `toVisibleChatItems`. Collapsing them to file cards would
 * break every stored transcript that renders correctly now, which is a far larger population than
 * the mislabelled files this exists to fix.
 *
 * Exported because the QUEUE asks the same question of a parked message (`parkedTiles` in
 * `chat-transcript.tsx`) and a second copy of this rule is a second thing to get wrong. Those tiles
 * are meant to be the ones the turn will draw once it runs, so two rules that disagreed would show
 * as a tile changing shape at the moment of sending.

 * has checked `toolCall.id` since the day it was written, with the reason in its own comment — "the
 * row it builds is keyed on the id". `message.id` is keyed on harder and was checked nowhere: it
 * becomes `VisibleChatItem.id`, which is DECLARED `string`, and downstream that one value is the
 * React key, `MessageScrollerItem`'s `messageId`, the turn-grouping key `anchorRowIds` and `turnOf`
 * cut apart at the last colon, and the memo key `createFirstPaintDelays` hangs an entrance delay
 * off.
 *
 * IT SURVIVED BECAUSE IT DOES NOT THROW — the same reason `readAttachmentMetadata` gives for its
 * own fields having gone unchecked, and the claim there that `metadata` was "the last unchecked
 * read in this file" was simply wrong; this was. A hole gets a text row `key={undefined}`, so React
 * warns and reconciles those rows by POSITION, and `data-message-id` is omitted so the scroller
 * never registers the row and it can never be a scroll anchor. The attachments row is quieter and
 * worse: `` `${message.id}:attachments` `` stringifies the hole, so every id-less turn in a history
 * collides on the literal `"undefined:attachments"` — one render key, one registration, one delay,
 * and two people's files drawn as one row.
 *
 * SEPARATE FROM `isReadableMessage` RATHER THAN FOLDED INTO IT, and the difference is which pass
 * runs it. The results-gathering pass above reads only `role`, `toolCallId` and `content` off a
 * tool result and keys the map on the TOOL CALL's id, which `isReadableToolCall` already checks; it
 * never keys anything on `message.id`. Refusing an id-less tool result there would drop the entry
 * from `results`, and the tool line it answers would then render as still-in-flight and shimmer for
 * ever — trading a real defect for a quieter one. So the object check guards both passes and the id
 * check guards only the pass that needs it.
 *
 * SKIPPING THE MESSAGE IS THE ANSWER RATHER THAN SYNTHESISING AN ID, because an id we invented
 * would be stable only within one render: `toVisibleChatItems` runs again on every chunk of a
 * streaming answer, so a counter or a `crypto.randomUUID()` would hand React a different key for
 * the same row on every frame and remount the message — entrance animation, scroll registration and
 * all — several times a second. A row nobody can key is a row this projection cannot draw, and
 * dropping it costs that row alone, which is the caution every other guard in this file takes.
 *
 * `""` IS REFUSED ALONGSIDE A NON-STRING, for the reason `readAttachmentMetadata` refuses an empty
 * `attachmentId`: it is a string, so a bare `typeof` admits it, and it names nothing. Two turns
 * carrying it collide on `":attachments"` exactly as two holes collide on `"undefined:attachments"`.

       * that cannot decode — the honest tile for a kind this app has no viewer for — and a declared
       * type is never given the chance to claim a picture the bytes do not support.

         * `source: { type: "url", value }` and carries no `mimeType` — so this call always falls
         * through to `part.type`. What changed is what `part.type` MEANS: that function now derives
         * it with this same `attachmentModality`, off the `mimeType` the server sniffed from the
         * bytes, instead of casting the browser's claim. The stored `type` is the corroborated
         * answer, so falling back to it is right rather than merely tolerable.
         *
         * The call keeps both arguments anyway. It costs nothing, it is the same rule the parked
         * tiles apply, and if a stored part ever does carry a `mimeType` — see the paragraph below,
         * which is the obvious way to fix history — this reads it without another change here.
         *
         * WHAT IS STILL WRONG IS HISTORY, AND ONLY HISTORY. A thread stored before that change kept
         * whatever the browser claimed, and no amount of client work will correct a row that is
         * already written. Putting it right means whoever serves a stored thread to the browser
         * supplying the type the attachment row already holds — a server change, written down here
         * rather than quietly half-done.
