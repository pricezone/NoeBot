/**
 * A file staged on the composer, described the way a sent one is.

 * So that a parked message draws the SAME tiles the turn will draw once it runs, rather than a
 * second rendering of an attachment that has to be kept in step with this one. The composer's
 * `onUpload` has already put the row on the server and handed back its url — `canSendDraft` refuses
 * to send, and therefore to park, anything still uploading — so there is always something to point
 * at by the time one of these reaches here.
 *
 * Anything that is not a picture becomes a document tile, which is what the sent row does with the
 * modalities it has no preview for: a card naming the file is the honest drawing of "this came
 * along", and the alternative is a broken thumbnail.
 *
 * WHICH ONES ARE PICTURES IS ASKED OF THE SERVER'S ANSWER, NOT OF `attachment.type`, and this is
 * the one surface in the browser where that answer is actually in hand. `attachment.type` is the
 * SDK's `getModalityFromMimeType(file.type)` from before the upload, never revisited when the
 * upload replies; `attachment.source.mimeType` is what OUR `onUpload` put there, and that is
 * `body.mimeType` — the type the server earned from `sniffMimeType` over the bytes
 * (`composer/attachments.ts`). A PNG the browser called `text/plain` has `type: "document"` and
 * `source.mimeType: "image/png"`, and this used to draw a grey card over it.
 *
 * A PARKED MESSAGE HOLDS THE LIVE `Attachment`, WHICH IS WHY THIS CAN BE PUT RIGHT AND THE SENT ROW
 * CANNOT. `QueuedMessage.attachments` is `Attachment[]` — the staged object itself, source and all
 * — whereas a sent turn has been through `toAttachmentPart` (`channel-chat.tsx`), which rebuilds
 * the source as `{ type: "url", value }` and drops the `mimeType` on the floor. So the two tiles
 * genuinely can disagree for as long as that line stands: a mislabelled picture draws correctly
 * here and reverts to a file card the moment the turn runs.
 *
 * That flip is a real cost and it is still the right way round. It is the symptom of the missing
 * line rather than a reason to keep this tile wrong on purpose, and the alternative — throwing away
 * an answer we hold so that both surfaces are wrong together — is the kind of consistency that
 * hides the defect instead of paying it down. `attachmentModality` is shared with the sent path
 * precisely so that fixing the source there needs no second change here.

 *
 * WHAT THAT SHARING IS WORTH, CORRECTED. This comment used to say a duplicate probe was "a
 * duplicate megabyte read, not a duplicate status line", because at the time a HEAD reached a
 * handler whose single statement selected `attachments.bytes`. It does not any more: the route
 * grew a branch that answers a HEAD from `name, mimeType, sizeBytes` and never touches the bytes.
 * A duplicate probe is now exactly the duplicate status line this once said it was not.
 *
 * IT STILL EARNS ITS KEEP, FOR A REASON THAT DOES NOT DEPEND ON THE OLD COST. Nothing else in the
 * stack will coalesce these: the route serves `private, no-cache`, so the browser's HTTP cache is
 * required to revalidate every probe rather than answer one from the other, and two tiles for one
 * file are two components with two effects and no knowledge of each other. Without this map the
 * same question goes over the wire once per tile, every time the transcript mounts. It is a dozen
 * lines to ask it once, and cheap-per-answer is not the same as free-per-answer.
 *
 * IN FLIGHT ONLY, AND DELIBERATELY NOT A CACHE OF THE ANSWERS — and THIS is the half the old cost
 * model was never holding up. Holding onto "this file is still there" across remounts is exactly
 * the lie this hook exists to stop: a file deleted while the reader has the app open would go on
 * drawing as an intact card for as long as the tab lived, which is the "worse of the two lies" the
 * comment below names. That was the argument then and it is the whole argument now. Holding onto

/**
 * Whether the row behind a document has been deleted, asked of the server that serves it.
 *
 * A DOCUMENT HAS NO OTHER WAY TO FIND OUT. The picture beside it learns its file is gone by
 * fetching it: the `<img>` requests the url, the route answers 404, and `onError` fires. A document
 * tile is a filename and a label — it requests nothing, so no event about the file can ever reach
 * it — and `failedToLoad` was the only thing feeding the absent branch. A deleted document
 * therefore kept drawing as an intact card naming a file the server was answering 404 for, which
 * is the worse of the two lies: a broken picture at least looks broken.
 *
 * `HEAD` because the question is whether the row exists and the status line is the whole answer, so
 * the reader is not made to download a PDF to learn it is still there. AND IT IS NOW CHEAP ON THE
 * SERVER TOO, WHICH IT ONCE WAS NOT AND WHICH THIS COMMENT WENT ON ASSERTING AFTER IT STOPPED BEING
 * TRUE. The old paragraph was right about the mechanism — Hono does answer a HEAD by dispatching
 * the GET handler in full and dropping the body at the last step — and it concluded that the server
 * therefore still read the whole file out of Postgres, and that a route which could answer "is it
 * there" without the bytes "is not this file's to write". Somebody wrote it. The attachment route
 * now branches on the method INSIDE the handler Hono actually dispatches, selects `sizeBytes`
 * instead of `bytes`, and sets `Content-Length` by hand; the access join, the statuses and the
 * revalidation are the GET's exactly, so a probe still learns nothing a fetch would not tell you.
 *
 * That is recorded here rather than quietly deleted because this file spent two review rounds being
 * read as evidence that the cheap probe did not exist. A comment describing a path as broken, about
 * a path that works, costs more than no comment at all.
 *
 * A REQUEST THAT NEVER ARRIVED IS NOT A DELETED FILE, so a rejected fetch — offline, a dropped
 * connection, a proxy in the way — leaves the card alone rather than accusing the server of having
 * lost somebody's file.
 *
 * AND NEITHER IS A REQUEST THE SERVER REFUSED, which is the same rule and was the bug. This asked
 * `!response.ok`, which is every status outside 200-299, when exactly one of them means what the
 * tile then says. The route collapses "no such row", "channel deleted" and "not a channel of
 * yours" into 404 precisely so that probing ids learns nothing — that is the one status that means
 * "there is no file here for you". Everything else is a fact about the request:
 *
 *   - 401 is a session that expired while the channel sat open, and it turned EVERY document tile
 *     in the transcript into a red card asserting, in each file's own name, that somebody's files
 *     had been deleted. Nothing had been; they need to sign in again.
 *   - 500 is a bad moment on the server, and it stuck: the deps below are stable, so nothing asks
 *     again and the accusation stands until the component remounts.
 *   - 304 is the strongest proof of PRESENCE this route can give — the row was found AND the
 *     membership join passed — and `Response.ok` is false for it.
 *
 * That is the same lie this hook exists to stop, pointing the other way, and it is the louder one:
 * drawn in the destructive vocabulary, naming the file. So absence is claimed on 404 alone, which
 * also puts a document back in step with the picture beside it — an `<img>` handed a 401 shows a
 * broken image, not a sentence swearing the file was deleted.

             *
             * THAT IS A KNOWN, UNPAID DEBT AND NOT AN OVERSIGHT. The fixes available from inside
             * this file were each tried on paper and each breaks something worse: `aria-owns` needs
             * a generated id per row and re-sequences only the accessibility tree, leaving tab
             * order inverted; positive `tabIndex` hijacks the tab sequence of the whole page;
             * hoisting the queue out of `MessageScrollerContent` into a sibling region — the
             * cleanest END STATE, since a parked message is genuinely not a log entry — puts it
             * outside a column that is `min-h-full`, so it lands below the fold on a short
             * transcript, outside the `gap-6` rhythm, and outside the spacer's height arithmetic.
             * Paying it properly means the scroller identifying new rows by identity rather than by
             * position, which is the library's to change and is worth asking for.
