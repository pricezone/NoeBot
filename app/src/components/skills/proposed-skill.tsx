 * will appear in everybody's `/` menu with somebody's name on it, and a person should read the
 * instruction their Bot drafted before it starts running on their behalf. The second is the slug:
 * saving is how an edit is spelled, so an unattended save can replace a skill somebody is using.
 *
 * So the whole tool is this card. There is no handler behind it — the run suspends here, and nothing
 * is written until a button is pressed.
