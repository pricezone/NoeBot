/**
 * The coworker a Bot has written, put in front of the person before it exists.

 * WHY THERE IS A CARD AT ALL. A coworker is not a document: the role description below becomes a
 * standing instruction handed to a model on every turn in every channel it is in, and it was written
 * by something that was told about the job second-hand. So the same rule the template consent screen
 * follows applies here — the whole of that text is shown, unabridged and unclipped, before anything
 * is created, because a person cannot agree to instructions they were not shown.
 *
 * The whole tool is this card. There is no handler behind it: the run suspends here, and nothing is
 * written until a button is pressed.
 *
 * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY CANNOT DO. No address, no connector, no tool, no boundary and no visibility
 * change. The coworker arrives private, holding whatever skills were agreed and nothing else, and
 * everything it might reach is granted afterwards on its profile by somebody who may. A card that
 * could grant capability would make "ask the Bot for it" the fastest route around the screens that
 * exist to decide it.
