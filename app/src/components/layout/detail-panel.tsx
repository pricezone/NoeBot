 * A main pane with details beside it when there is room, or in a sheet on narrow windows.
 *
 * The open/closed state belongs to the caller. `open` is the demand — in practice a search
 * parameter or a Bot asking for attention — and opens the pane in either shape, so a detail that
 * was asked for is a real navigation: it survives a reload, it can be linked to, and Back closes
 * it. `preferOpen` is the standing preference — the bot panel is open unless somebody closed it —
 * and it opens the inline pane only. A sheet is an overlay over the conversation, and a preference
 * must not cover the chat on a phone every time it loads; there the panel waits to be asked for.
 *
 * The pane is animated by width and the content inside it is given that width outright, so the
 * content is laid out once and the pane reveals it.
