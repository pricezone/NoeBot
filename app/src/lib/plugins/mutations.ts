 *
 * ON `onSettled` AND NEVER ON `onSuccess`, ON EVERY WRITE BELOW, AND IT IS ONE FACT ABOUT THE SERVER
 * RATHER THAN A PREFERENCE. NOT ONE OF THESE ENDPOINTS IS ATOMIC. Every one of them writes something
 * durable and then does something else that can fail, so a refusal is not evidence that nothing
 * changed — it is very often the opposite, and the write it leaves behind is exactly the one the
 * screen is drawing.
 *
 * THE SHAPE, IN THE SERVER'S OWN WORDS. `POST /servers` inserts the row and then refreshes the
 * server's tools, answering 409 when that refresh faults over a row that is now there.
 * `POST /composio/apps` creates the authorization config at Composio, writes the row, and says so in
 * its own 409. `POST /grants`, `DELETE /grants`, `POST /skills` and `DELETE /skills/:slug` each
 * commit and then file the trail row, and a failing audit insert is a 500 over a change that
 * happened. `DELETE /servers/:id/connection` revokes the account at the vendor before it deletes
 * anything here. And the two brokered writes the screens draw hardest on raise from inside the
 * store AFTER recording what they found: `recheckBrokeredConnection` writes the verdict and the
 * action it spent and then raises with Composio's refusal, and `connectBrokeredWithFields` records
 * the account it could not withdraw and then raises with a sentence telling the person to disconnect
 * it — on a page that, refetching only on success, went on offering them Connect.
 *
 * WHAT `onSuccess` COST, PRECISELY. It made the browser's copy of the deployment diverge on exactly
 * the presses where a person is reading hardest: a banner carrying the server's refusal, over a row
 * still drawn from the state before the request. Two readings of one screen in one paint, and the
 * stale one is always the reassuring one. `onSettled` runs on both outcomes, so the screen is drawn
 * from what the deployment holds NOW rather than from what the press was hoping for — which costs a
 * refused write one refetch and is the only rule under which the row and the banner can agree.
 *
 * THE ONE WRITE-SHAPED PRESS THIS DOES NOT APPLY TO is {@link brokeredConnectionFieldsMutationOptions},
 * which asks what an app wants typed in. That is a question about the app rather than about
 * anybody's account, it writes nothing on either outcome, and it takes no `QueryClient` at all — so

 *
 * A name rather than a URL. The server narrows it to a known set before signing it into the state,
 * so this parameter cannot become an open redirect however it is called.
 *
 * NO URL IS A REAL ANSWER AND THE CALLER HAS TO BRANCH ON IT. One route serves both kinds of
 * brokered app: it answers `{ authorizationUrl }` to a press on an app somebody consents to, and
 * `{ fields }` to a press on one whose key somebody types. This unwraps the first key, so a press
 * that landed on the second kind unwraps nothing — and while this was declared `Promise<string>`
 * the one caller assigned that nothing to `window.location.href`, which the browser resolves
 * against the current document and follows: a person pressing Connect was taken to a page called
 * `undefined` on this deployment's own origin, having been told nothing.
 *
 * AND IT IS NOT A HYPOTHETICAL, because the two processes decide it from two copies of one list.
 * The screen's `FIELD_SCHEMES` says which schemes are typed and the server's `isFieldScheme` says

 * tomorrow, which the screen would read as consent — deliberately, because an unknown scheme is
 * better sent to a consent screen than to an empty form — and the route would answer a form to.
 * That is the state this type now describes rather than hides.
 *
 * `null` RATHER THAN `undefined`, AND THE DIFFERENCE IS THE WHOLE OF WHY THIS WENT UNNOTICED.
 * `mutationFn` is an OPTIONAL property, so `useMutation` infers its data type out of
 * `MutationFunction<T, …> | undefined` — and matching that against the source strips the
 * `undefined` from both sides, `T`'s own included. A `Promise<string | undefined>` here therefore
 * reaches every caller as a bare `string`: `onSuccess` binds its parameter to `string`, the
 * assignment to `window.location.href` typechecks, and the compiler has been told the same lie in
 * a second place. `null` is the one absent-value this inference cannot quietly discard, which is
