/**
 * Every app-wide keyboard shortcut, in one place.
 *
 * One place on purpose: the binding a listener matches against and the combo the settings page
 * shows a person are the same entry, so they cannot drift apart. Adding a shortcut is adding an
 * entry here and one `useHotkey` call where it acts; the settings list picks it up by itself.
 *
 * Browsers reserve their own combos. Cmd/Ctrl+N — the obvious key for "new chat" — opens a new
 * browser window before the page ever sees the keystroke, and `preventDefault` is ignored for
 * reserved shortcuts, so no entry here can use one. Plain Shift+letter combos work everywhere,
 * at the cost that they are also just how capital letters are typed — which is why `useHotkey`
 * ignores them while focus is in anything editable.
