 * coworker the person picked must have one too, or the trail reads as if the row failed to write.
 * The home composer told the server about an `@` choice; a coworker picked in the To: field of
 * `/channel/new` — the sidebar's +, a coworker's card, its profile — was never told to anybody. The
 * two screens now share this one sequence: record, then start.
 *
 * The record is told before the channel exists, the way the routed path records before a channel is
 * pinned, and its answer is thrown away: the person already decided and nothing here may change
 * that. Failing to write the row must not stop the conversation, so a rejection is swallowed whole.
 * Pure so the sequence can be tested; the hook below binds it to the real calls.
