/**
 * Editing a coworker that runs on this deployment's own Bot.
 *
 * A coworker created as "Built in" on a deployment with a managed Bot is stored pointing at that
 * Bot's address, and the profile publishes it, with `builtIn` beside it so a screen can tell. The
 * Connection section already reads that flag and does not show "an internal address they never
 * typed". The General section did not: every in-place edit sent the whole profile back, endpoint
 * included, and `PATCH /api/agents/:id` checks an endpoint it is sent the way it checks one a person
 * typed. `scripts/start.sh` points the managed Bot at `http://localhost:4201/ag-ui`, which that check
 * refuses unless private hosts are opened, so on that deployment a built-in coworker could not be
 * renamed, retitled, redescribed or made public at all.
 *
 * The routes are the server's own, mounted behind `fetch` the way `agent-api-path.test.ts` mounts
 * them, so the refusal is the real one. The dialog is drawn in a router of one route, for the
 * `useNavigate` its General section holds.
