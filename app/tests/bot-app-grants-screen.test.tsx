/**
 * What the per-Bot grant screen draws: which of its three pages a failed read returns, and the one
 * mark a row carries beyond the action's own name.
 *
 * Most of it is about the failure. Same mistake, same shape, as `agent-roster-error.test.tsx`: the screen branched on the app being
 * absent from `plugins.data`, and `isPending` goes false on a failed fetch exactly as it does on a
 * successful one — so a request that never came back was rendered as "this deployment has not
 * enabled an app by that name", about an app that may be enabled and granted right now. The Bot
 * half of the same function always got this right (`agents.data && !bot`), which is what made the
 * app half visible.
 *
 * The last case is no failure at all: the danger mark on a destructive action. It is here because
 * this is where the harness that draws this screen lives, and it needs both halves — the marked row
 * and the unmarked one — since `destructive: false` is the vendor making no claim rather than a
 * claim of safety, and a row that read as reassuring on that evidence would say more than anybody
 * knows. It draws off the same seeded page as the failed-refetch case above.
 *
 * `bot-app-grants.test.tsx` is the other half of this screen's coverage and deliberately renders
 * nothing — it asserts the bulk button's set through the exported `readOnlyRefs`. This file has to
 * draw, because what is under test is what reaches the page, so it is its own file rather than a
 * DOM smuggled into that one.
 *
 * THE HARNESS IS THIS REPOSITORY'S, copied from `agent-roster-error.test.tsx` for the reasons
 * recorded there: `GlobalRegistrator` in `beforeAll`/`afterAll`, `cleanup` in `afterEach`, queries
 * off `render()`'s own return, and a `QueryClient` with `retry: false` so a failing query settles
 * in one attempt.
