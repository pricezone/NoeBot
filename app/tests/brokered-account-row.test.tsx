/**
 * The brokered account row, on both screens that draw it.
 *
 * Neither screen had a test, which is how two defects survived a wave review and a final one.
 *
 * THE FIRST is that a successful disconnect went on reading "Connected". The row's state is
 * `confirmBrokered.data?.connected ?? <the recorded row>`, and a mutation's `data` is not query
 * state: disconnecting invalidated the queries, the recorded row went away, and the vendor's old
 * answer — set by the confirm-on-mount, whose dependencies had not changed — kept winning. The
 * person read that as a failure and pressed Disconnect again, and the second DELETE reached a store
 * method with no row-existence check, which revoked nothing and filed a second
 * `mcp.account_disconnected` entry about an account that was already gone.
 *
 * THE SECOND is a deployment with no Composio key. The confirm answers 503, both screens swallow
 * it by design, and the state fell back to the stale local row — so every reader was told
 * "Connected" on a deployment that cannot reach the broker at all, with no sign anything was wrong
 * until a Bot call refused. `docs/plugins/composio.md` has always claimed the page says the key is
 * missing; nothing implemented it.
 *
 * THE HARNESS IS THIS REPOSITORY'S, from `agent-roster-error.test.tsx` and
 * `bot-app-grants-screen.test.tsx`: `GlobalRegistrator` in `beforeAll`/`afterAll`, `cleanup` in
 * `afterEach`, queries off `render()`'s own return, a `QueryClient` with `retry: false`, and the
 * capture-and-restore of each exported `Route` singleton those files document at length — bun walks
 * every file into one process, and `.update()` merges into the live object rather than replacing it.
 *
 * What is NOT copied from them is the always-failing `fetch`. What is under test here is a sequence
 * — confirmed live, then disconnected, then read again — so the stub below is a small in-memory
 * deployment that answers each endpoint from state a test can set and a DELETE can change, rather
 * than one canned response. It also counts the DELETEs, which is the only way to assert the second
 * press cannot happen rather than merely that the word changed.

/**
 * EVERY OUTCOME ONE CHECK OF A BROKERED ACCOUNT CAN HAVE, as the SERVER names them — `BrokeredProbe`
 * in `server/src/plugins/store.ts` — beside the row each one leaves for this screen to read.
 *
 * THE MAPPING IS THIS FILE'S; THE LIST OF OUTCOMES IS THE SERVER'S. The server added a fourth
 * outcome (`unreachable`) after this screen was written, and nothing in either process was in a
 * position to notice: the two share no module, the outcome never travels as a word, and what
 * reaches the browser is the PAIR `{ verified, probe }` the writers leave on `composio_connections`.
 * So this roster is the mapping itself — server outcomes onto the row shapes a page load reads —
 * and the test below drives the real row through each of them.
 *
 * WHICH IS WHY THE COMPLETENESS TEST NO LONGER COUNTS THIS AGAINST A LIST OF ITS OWN. For two
 * rounds it did: `["nothing", "answered", "complained", "unreachable"]` written out at the assertion,
 * in this file, compared to the `outcome` fields above it — a fifth member on the server's real
 * `BrokeredProbe` passed that, which is exactly the drift the test was added to catch. It now
 * counts against `BROKERED_PROBE_OUTCOMES`, imported from `server/src/plugins/store.ts`, which that
 * module pins to the union in both directions with `satisfies` and a `Decides<…>` witness.
 *
 * `SERVER_FIELD_SCHEMES` ABOVE IS STILL A COPY AND STILL SHOULD BE, which is not the same case: it
 * earns its copy by carrying a scheme the screen has never heard of, and a disagreement is the one
 * thing an import cannot state. This roster claimed that defence and never used it.
 *
 * THE ROW SHAPES ARE THE WRITERS' OWN. `connectBrokeredWithFields` derives `verified` from
 * `outcome === "answered"` and records `probed.probe`, which `BrokeredProbe` withholds on both
 * outcomes where nothing can be shown to have been spent; `recheckBrokeredConnection` writes the
 * same pair for the two outcomes that reach its writer.
 *
 * A FIFTH CLIENT READING EXISTS AND IS NOT A SERVER OUTCOME: `probe: undefined` is the field being
 * absent, which is a held connection's row and no check at all. It is covered by its own case above
 * and is deliberately not in this roster, because nothing on this list can produce it.

 * A CONNECTIONS READ THAT FAILED IS SAID, NOT DEFAULTED TO "YOU HAVE NEVER CONNECTED THIS".

 * be read.
 *
 * REASON. Every fact the row draws — `recorded`, `verified`, `verifiedAt`, `probe`, `checkable` —
 * comes off the connections read, and both screens gated their render on the PLUGINS query and
 * consulted neither `connections.isPending` nor `connections.error`. So a 500 there left
 * `connection` undefined and the row was handed `recorded: false, verified: false, probe: undefined,
 * checkable: false` — a connection nobody has made. For a key app whose last check did not come back
 * clean that is the exact state this feature exists to keep visible: the page dropped the sentence,
 * withdrew Disconnect AND Re-check, and drew Connect instead. Pressing it opens the form and the
 * route refuses the submission — "you already have an account, disconnect it first" — so the only
 * two controls that could end the state are the two the page had just taken away, and no error text
 * appeared anywhere, because the connect mutation's `onError` was each route's only error branch.

 * has nothing honest to say when that state could not be read.

/**
 * A RE-CHECK THAT SPENT NOTHING LEAVES THE RECORDED VERDICT EXACTLY WHERE IT FOUND IT.
 *
 * CRITERION. On a row recording a key the vendor checked and refused, a re-check answering a null
 * probe leaves the row still saying so. The press wrote nothing, so it may unwrite nothing.
 *
 * THIS FILE USED TO PIN THE OPPOSITE, under `a re-check that spent nothing overrules the action the
 * record still names`, on the reading that "an answer beats the record" and that the answer's null
 * is the server saying this check spent nothing. The first half is right and the second is the
 * mistake: `probe` on THIS route is what the PRESS spent, and `probe` on the connections read is
 * what the last check that spent anything WROTE DOWN. They are not two records of one thing, so the
 * newer of the two does not win — the newer one is not a record at all.
 *
 * AND `recheckBrokeredConnection` SAYS SO IN THE ONLY WAY THAT MATTERS: on this outcome it returns
 * before the writer, deliberately, so that "a check which could try nothing writes nothing at all".
 * The row it read is untouched, `probe_action` still names the action the vendor refused, and the
 * very next connections read answers with that name again.
 *
 * WHAT THE OLD RULE COST, WHICH IS WHY IT IS WORTH A TEST RATHER THAN A COMMENT. The row flipped
 * from the worst state this feature has — your key was rejected and the account still stands at
 * Composio, with two named ways out — to "accepted without being checked … that is about the app,
 * not about your key", which is an absolution. AND THE PRESS TOOK THE BUTTON WITH IT: the outcome
 * is `nothing` precisely when `probeActionFor` answers null, which is the same read the listing
 * draws `checkable` from, so the refetch that follows withdraws Re-check. Nothing in the interface
 * could then put the true sentence back.
