/**
 * Which brokered apps the Connected accounts page lists, decided without drawing anything.
 *
 * The page's own rule for the catalogue half is "only vendors reached as a person": a vendor with a
 * shared token is left off because it "has nothing for you to decide". A Composio `NO_AUTH` app has
 * exactly as little, one layer further in — there is no account to make, `/servers/:id/connect`
 * refuses to create one, and the call gate lets such a call through with no connection row at all —
 * and the brokered filter took every `composio` row regardless.
 *
 * WHAT THAT PUT ON EVERY PERSON'S PAGE was a permanently grey "Not connected" row for an app nobody
 * can connect, which reads as an unfinished task and can never turn green. Clicking it lands on a
 * page that says the app needs no account and draws no button, so the list and the page it opens
 * contradict each other — and the list is the more believable of the two.
 *
 * A `.tsx` file because it imports a route module, which is JSX; the precedent is
 * `composio-picker.test.tsx`, which exports its own rule as a function for this same reason.
