/**
 * What the Composio picker lists, decided without drawing anything.
 *
 * The screen reads a directory of a few hundred apps, some of which this deployment already has.
 * Two facts about that list are worth pinning: the order it is read in, and that the two fields a
 * decision actually rests on — whether the app is already here, and how much it brings with it —
 * arrive at the row intact.
 *
 * Nothing here renders — `matchingApps` is exported from `composio-app-list.tsx` as a function
 * rather than left inline in the map for exactly that reason, so the ordering and the
 * already-added marker can be asserted without a DOM, a router or a query client. The list is
 * drawn by the admin Browse Composio page and the Marketplace's "Featured plugins" alike.
