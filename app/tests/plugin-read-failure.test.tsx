/**
 * A connector's own pages, when `GET /api/plugins` fails.
 *
 * Each of them decides whether the connector exists from `plugins.data`, and `isPending` goes false
 * on a failed fetch exactly as it does on a successful one, so a request that never came back fell
 * through to "there is no such connector" — about a connector that may be added and granted right
 * now. The per-Bot grant screen beside them already tells the two apart (`plugins.data && !server`,
 * see `bot-app-grants-screen.test.tsx`); these are the three pages that did not.
 *
 * Only the plugins read fails here. The connections and roster reads answer, so each case is about
 * that one read and nothing else on the page.
 *
 * THE HARNESS IS THIS REPOSITORY'S, as in `bot-app-grants-screen.test.tsx` and
 * `brokered-account-row.test.tsx`: `GlobalRegistrator` in `beforeAll`/`afterAll`, `cleanup` in
 * `afterEach`, queries off `render()`'s own return, a `QueryClient` with `retry: false`, and each
 * exported `Route` singleton captured and restored around its `.update()`.
