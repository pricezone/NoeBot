/**
 * What every plugin write does about the screen when the server says no.
 *
 * THE PROPERTY, STATED ONCE FOR A WHOLE FILE. Not one of these endpoints is atomic. Every one of
 * them writes — a row, an audit entry, a revoke at another company — and then does something else
 * that can fail, and Hono answers the failure with a status while the write stands. `POST /servers`
 * inserts the row and then refreshes its tools, and answers 409 when that refresh faults;
 * `POST /grants` upserts the grant and then files the trail row, and answers 500 when that insert
 * does; `DELETE /servers/:id/connection` revokes the account at Composio and then deletes the row.
 * A refusal from any of them is therefore NOT evidence that nothing changed, and a mutation that
 * refetched only on success left the screen asserting a state the deployment had already left.
 *
 * IT IS THE SAME DEFECT TWO REVIEWERS FOUND ON TWO ROUTES, and the reason it is tested here rather
 * than only where they found it: the shape is a property of the file, so a test per symptom would
 * have pinned two of fourteen and left the next one to be found the same way. Both of theirs are
 * below — a re-check the vendor refused, whose verdict the store wrote before raising, and a key
 * whose account Composio would not take back — beside the twelve that share their shape.
 *
 * THE STATUS EACH CASE SENDS IS THE ONE ITS OWN ROUTE SENDS, read off `server/src/plugins/routes.ts`
 * rather than chosen for convenience. A stub answering a shape a route cannot produce is what let
 * the two findings survive a review in the first place, and repeating that here would buy a green
 * file and nothing else.
 *
 * THROUGH A REAL `MutationObserver`, SO REACT QUERY DECIDES WHICH CALLBACKS RUN. Calling
 * `options.onSettled` by hand would pass against a file that merely declares the property, which is
 * not the question — the question is what happens to the screen when a press is refused.
